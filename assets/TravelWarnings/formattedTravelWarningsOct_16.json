      "Proceed through intersections with caution as traffic signs are often hidden or nonexistent. Roads are very slippery when it rains. Watch out for scooters, motorcycles, and ATVs, as drivers of these vehicles do not strictly follow traffic rules. Be alert for speeding cars and drunk drivers. In rural areas, watch out for goats and other animals that cross the road unexpectedly. Night driving is reasonably safe, as long as drivers are familiar with the route and road conditions. Roads are not as well-lit as in theUnited States. Driving while intoxicated is punishable by fine and imprisonment.",

Traffic signs prohibiting actions have a red circle around them, but not the red slash you expect to see in the United States. Local law requires drivers and passengers to wear seat belts, and motorcyclists to wear helmets. Children must ride in the back seat, and children under 5 years of age must be in a child safety seat.",

According to the World Health Organization, the UAE has the highest rate of road fatalities in the Middle East and one of the highest rates in the world. Drivers often drive at high speeds. Unsafe driving practices are common, especially on inter-city highways. On highways, unmarked speed bumps and drifting sand create additional hazards. Pedestrians should also use great care on the roads of the UAE – over 25 percent of road fatalities are pedestrians.",

In the UAE, there is zero tolerance for driving after consumption of alcohol. Persons arrested for drinking and driving are often jailed for many days as they await a court hearing. Penalties may include hefty jail sentences, fines, and, for Muslims (even those holding U.S. citizenship), lashings. Persons involved in an accident in which another party is injured automatically go to jail until the injured person is released from the hospital. Should a person die in a traffic accident, the driver of the other vehicle is liable for payment of compensation for the death (known as &quot;dhiyya&quot;), usually the equivalent of 55,000 U.S. dollars. Even relatively minor accidents may result in lengthy proceedings, during which both drivers may be prohibited from leaving the country.",

Foreign driver's licenses are not recognized for residents of the UAE, however, U.S. citizen visitors who are not UAE residents can drive using a valid driver’s license issued by his or her state.

The importation and possession of poppy seeds in any and all forms, including as dried decorative plants, are strictly prohibited. Persons found to possess even very small quantities of controlled substances listed by the UAE are subject to prosecution by the authorities and may be given lengthy prison terms of up to 15 years. Persons may be charged and convicted even if the controlled substances were ingested outside of the UAE as long as traces are still present in the bloodstream upon arrival in the UAE.",
      "Travelers with questions regarding the items on the list of controlled substances should contact the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai .

If the account holder does not have sufficient funds, he/she may be charged with passing a bad check. Bail generally is not available to non-residents of the UAE who are arrested for crimes involving fraud. Debtors can be held in prison until their debts are paid or until an agreement is reached between the parties. Passports may be seized by the UAE government to guarantee that debtors settle their cases. Financial cases may be further complicated by debtors being unable to work in the UAE without passports while still being held responsible for their debts.",
      "Scams: U.S. citizens have also been the victims of email scams seemingly originating from the UAE. Con artists contact Americans through the internet, including dating web sites.

Co-conspirators may pose as UAE based lawyers or medical professionals to verify the story and the supposed urgent need for cash. Some victims have lost tens of thousands of dollars from such scams. Email scams have become increasingly sophisticated using fake websites and we have even heard of individuals taking American citizens’ email addresses in order to pose as legitimate American businesses. Recipients of such emails alleging a U.S. citizen is experiencing a medical, legal, financial, or other type of emergency in the UAE should ask the sender to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance as soon as possible.

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES:",
      "While you are traveling in Afghanistan, you are subject to its laws even if you are a U.S. citizen. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own and may not afford the same protections available to you under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. In addition, U.S. citizens are still subject to U.S. federal laws while traveling or living abroad. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime prosecutable in the United States. If you break local laws in Afghanistan, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution and may result in heightened attention by police and prosecutors, some of whom may seek to exploit your status as a U.S. citizen for financial or political gain. It is very important to know what constitutes legal and illegal actions in the area where you are traveling. Persons violating Afghan laws, even unknowingly, may be fined, arrested, imprisoned, or possibly executed. In some areas of Afghanistan, you could be detained for questioning if you do not have your passport with you. Taking pictures of military installations or personnel may result in your questioning or detention. Possession of alcohol and driving under the influence could land you in jail for several months. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Afghanistan are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. In addition to being subject to all Afghan laws, Afghan-Americans may also be subject to other laws that impose special obligations on Afghan citizens Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. We encourage U.S. citizens to carry a copy of their U.S. passport with them at all times, so that if questioned by local officials, proof of identity and U.S. citizenship is readily available. Due to security and travel limitations, consular assistance for U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is limited, particularly for those persons outside the capital.",

Apostasy may carry a maximum penalty of death for Muslims who denounce Islam or convert to another religion. Allegations of conversion of Afghan citizens are taken particularly seriously. Sexual relations between unmarried couples are generally forbidden, and visitors to Afghanistan should be discreet in this regard.",

On May 17, three members of the European Union’s police mission (Eupol) were killed in a suicide attack near Kabul International Airport, and on August 22, three U.S. citizen contractors were killed by a vehicle-borne explosive device in Kabul. In June 2015, a Dutch aid worker was kidnapped in Kabul by insurgents and held for 81 days, and on August 17 a German citizen working for the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) was kidnapped for ransom. On October 11, three Afghan civilians were wounded during a vehicle-borne explosive device attack against a Coalition convoy in Kabul. Additionally, on September 28 Taliban forces overran the city of Kunduz. The capture marked the first time since 2001 that the Taliban had taken control of a major city in Afghanistan and demonstrates that the insurgent threat exists beyond the capital. On 8-9 December, the Taliban conducted a prolonged assault on perimeter of the Kandahar airport, killing scores of civilians. On December 11, Taliban attackers detonated a car bomb near the Spanish Embassy, killing two Spanish security officials and four Afghan police officers.",
      "Demonstrations and Riots: Riots, sometimes violent, have occurred in response to various political and social tensions. As a recent example, on November 11, 2015, guards opened fire on demonstrators who attempted to scale the walls of the Afghan Ministry of Defense while protesting the beheading of seven ethnic Hazaras in Zabul Province. U.S. citizens should avoid rallies and demonstrations; even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little warning. Crime, including violent crime, remains a significant problem. U.S. citizens could be targeted or placed at risk by unpredictable events. There is also a real danger from the presence of millions of unexploded land mines and other ordnance. Private U.S. citizens should not travel to Afghanistan unless they have made arrangements in advance to address security concerns, including contracting for medical evacuation, personnel recovery, and insurance services.",
      "Explosives: Kabul remains at high risk for militant attacks, including vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attacks, direct and indirect fire, and suicide bombings. The same risks also exist in other major cities in Afghanistan, including but not limited to Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah, Maimana, Ghazni, and Jalalabad.",
      "Property: The absence of property ownership records and differing laws and competing legal regimes from the numerous political changes that have gripped Afghanistan in the past three decades have left the issue of property rights in disarray. Afghan-Americans returning to Afghanistan to recover property have become involved in complicated real estate disputes and have faced threats of retaliatory action, including kidnapping and assassinations. Similarly, U.S. citizens involved in business disputes -- a common legal problem in Afghanistan -- have reported that adversaries in the disputes have threatened detention, arrest, and imprisonment, and at times have successfully carried out the threats using extralegal means. Property and/or personnel may be seized and used as collateral pending the resolution of such disputes. U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. Embassy will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes.",
      "Communications: Large parts of Afghanistan are extremely isolated. The few roads that exist are mostly in poor condition. Land line telephone communications remain extremely limited. Cell phone service, while significantly improved from a decade ago, still suffers from irregular and weak signals, sometimes due to insurgents attacking cell phone towers or coercing operators into turning off the towers, or from intentional jamming by Coalition and Afghan forces. U.S. citizens traveling in or outside of Kabul who find themselves in trouble may be unable to call for assistance and should always carry backup communication, such as satellite phones or handheld radios. In addition, a vehicle/personnel tracking device should be utilized if substantial ground movement to remote areas is planned.",
      "CRIME: Criminal organizations, such as weapons and narcotics traffickers, undermine peace and stability throughout the country. These groups exploit weak laws and law enforcement in Afghanistan and do not hesitate to use violence to achieve their aims. Afghanistan is considered a medium to high threat environment for crime. Common petty or street crime exists in cities, particularly when valuables and cash are left in plain view. Burglaries and home invasions are rare, but violence against expatriates has risen in recent years in large part due to increased insurgent activity, civil unrest, and current economic conditions.",
      "Many Afghans are under or unemployed and have moved to urban areas in search of work. Transient populations and internally displaced peoples throughout Afghanistan may directly contribute to crime and lawlessness. Any U.S. citizen who enters Afghanistan should remain vigilant and take similar precautions to those they use in any urban center in the United States.",
      "Travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local or national authorities in Afghanistan in resolving legal disputes. This is especially true of U.S.-based companies and their employees that are seeking local protection from extralegal efforts to resolve contract disputes. Property and/or personnel may be seized and used as collateral pending the resolution of such disputes.",
      "Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. The participation of U.S. citizens in the unauthorized reproduction and sale of copyrighted works is still in violation of U.S. law outside of the United States and may also be in violation of local laws.",

      "Afghanistan has made significant progress since the Taliban was deposed in 2001, but still faces daunting challenges, including fighting an insurgency, preventing the return of terrorist organizations, recovering from three decades of civil strife, and rebuilding a shattered infrastructure. The U.S. Coalition and the Resolute Support Mission work in partnership with Afghan security forces to combat violent, extremist groups that continue to terrorize civilian populations and challenge all levels of government authority. These groups continue to engage in a fallback strategy of perpetrating violence against civilian targets, including assassinations, suicide bombings, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).",
      "Internal problems following years of war and an ongoing insurgency continue to compromise efforts by the Afghan government to improve the country’s governance and stability. The government faces challenges in trying to develop a more effective police force, a fairer and more accessible legal system, and provincial and local institutions that work in partnership with traditional leaders to meet the needs of the population. Although Afghan security forces took over responsibility for security nationwide in June 2013, the United States and the international community continue to work closely with the Afghan government to bolster its capacity at all levels.

Banks and reputable exchange houses generally require you to present your passport to exchange money. Tourists who might want to exchange pesos for foreign currency upon leaving the country should retain all receipts related to the purchase of pesos during visits to Argentina. Commodity exchange is not one of the services provided by U.S. Embassies for U.S. citizens abroad. Travelers should exercise caution when approached with offers of illegal exchange at rates more favorable than the official rate; there have been some incidents of scams in which travelers were robbed, some of them at gun point.

If your ATM card does not function at one ATM, you may successfully use it at another, or you may use a reputable bank or exchange house to obtain pesos.

Adventure Travel : Argentina’s mountains, forests, deserts, and glaciers make it a popular destination for outdoor and adventure sports enthusiasts. Despite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting visitors lost or injured in such remote areas can be difficult. U.S. citizens have died in recent years while mountain climbing, skiing, trekking, and hunting in Argentina. Argentina boasts the highest peak outside of the Himalayas, Mount Aconcagua. Its billing in some guidebooks as affordable and &quot;requiring no climbing skills&quot; attracts hundreds of U.S. citizens every year. In recent years, several U.S. citizens, including expert climbers, have lost their lives while climbing on Mount Aconcagua where rescue missions are often difficult or impossible to execute. Travelers visiting isolated and wilderness areas should learn about local hazards and weather conditions and always inform park or police authorities of their itineraries. Reports of missing or injured persons should be made immediately to the police so that a search can be mounted or assistance rendered. ACCESSIBILITY : While in Argentina, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. It is important to note that a specific law mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, while the federal government has protective laws, many provinces have not adopted the laws and have no mechanisms to ensure enforcement.",

      "Pedestrians and drivers should exercise caution, as drivers frequently ignore traffic laws, and vehicles often travel at excessive speeds. Demonstrations are common in metropolitan Buenos Aires and occur in other major cities as well. Protesters often block streets, highways, and major intersections, causing traffic jams and delaying travel. While demonstrations are usually nonviolent, some individuals break from larger groups and sometimes seek confrontation with the police and vandalize private property. U.S. citizens should take common-sense precautions and avoid any event where crowds congregate to protest. Public transportation is generally reliable and safe. The preferred option for travel within Buenos Aires and other major cities is by radio taxi or &quot;remise&quot; (private car with driver). Passengers on buses, trains, and the subway should be alert for pickpockets, especially during rush hours. Inter-urban passenger train service has been largely replaced by bus and plane service as a feasible and reliable option for most travelers. CRIME : Street crime in the larger cities, especially greater Buenos Aires, Rosario and Mendoza, is a constant problem for residents and visitors alike. As in any big city, visitors to Buenos Aires and popular tourist destinations should be alert to muggers, pickpockets, scam artists, and purse-snatchers on the street, in restaurants, in hotel lobbies, at bus and train stations, and in cruise ship ports. Be careful in San Telmo, an older traditional neighborhood specializing in antique stores, Recoleta, and La Boca neighborhood (home to the famous “Caminito” street and “Boca Juniors” soccer stadium) in Buenos Aires, where violent robberies occur with increasing frequency. While crime occurs at all times of day, tourists who go to La Boca should limit their visits to the designated tourist street during daylight hours only. Visitors should be aware that “villas” or shanty towns are present throughout Buenos Aires and other major cities, even in tourist zones, and should avoid entering these areas. A number of scams involving yellow and black taxis have been reported at international airports and around Buenos Aires. The most common scams include:",

A “handler” at the airport accepts payment for the taxi ride, and then the driver also demands the fare at the end of the ride. The taxi “breaks down” on the side of the road, and a second taxi comes to retrieve the passenger. Both drivers demand payment. To avoid these potential issues, either pre-arrange transportation or select one of the flat rate “remise” services from designated counters located inside the airport terminal. In town, radio taxis from a reliable location, such as a hotel, should be utilized whenever possible.",
      "Criminals usually work in groups, and travelers should assume they are armed. Be suspicious of anyone who approaches you on the street. A common scam is to spray mustard or another substance on the tourist from a distance. An accomplice proceeds to rob the victim while pretending to help clean the stain. Thieves on foot and motorcycles, “motochorros”, regularly nab purses, backpacks, laptops, and luggage, and criminals will often distract visitors for a few seconds to steal valuables. If traveling in a car, keep windows up and valuables in the trunk or on the floor boards. Do not place handbags on the back of your chair or on the floor at a restaurant; instead, keep them in your lap. While most U.S. citizens are not physically injured when robbed, visitors are advised to immediately hand over all cash and valuables if confronted. Thieves commonly target visitors wearing expensive watches or jewelry, carrying laptop computer cases, or talking on high-end cell phones. When staying in a hotel or apartment, it is a good precaution to call the front desk or security to identify uninvited individuals before giving them access. There have been a small number of reports of the use of date rape drugs in bars. Travelers should use caution entering and exiting financial institutions and when using ATM machines. Along with conventional muggings, &quot;express kidnappings&quot; occur. Victims are grabbed off of the street or are stopped in mobile vehicle road blocks based on their appearance and vulnerability. In some scenarios, they are forced to withdraw as much money as possible from ATM machines, and then their family or co-workers are contacted and told to deliver all the cash that they have on hand or can gather in a couple of hours. Once the ransom is paid, the victim is usually quickly released unharmed. There have been some foreign victims of express kidnappings. Visitors are particularly advised not to let children and adolescents travel alone. Virtual kidnappings (fake telephone kidnappings) are very common. Memorizing important phone numbers and, if robbed, immediately finding a phone and letting family members know you are alright are important in interrupting this cycle. Travelers worldwide are advised to avoid packing valuables in their checked baggage. In Argentina, officials have publicly acknowledged the systematic theft of valuables and money from checked baggage at Buenos Aires airports. Travelers should exercise continued care and caution. The U.S. Embassy has observed an increase in reports of stolen passports. Passports and other valuables should be locked in a hotel safe, and a photocopy of your passport should be carried for identification purposes.",

U.S. citizens do not need a visa for visits of up to 90 days for tourism or business. Travelers bearing diplomatic or official passports are required to get visas prior to arrival in Argentina. U.S. citizens who arrive in Argentina with expired or damaged passports may be refused entry and returned to the United States at their own expense. The U.S. Embassy cannot provide guarantees on behalf of travelers in such situations, and we encourage you to ensure that your travel documents are valid and in good condition prior to departure from the United States. Different rules apply to U.S. citizens who also have Argentine nationality, depending on their dates of U.S. naturalization. For more information, check the Argentine Ministry of the Interior website . Argentine-born naturalized U.S. citizens who enter Argentina as temporary visitors may depart using their U.S. passports as long as they remain no longer than the period granted by the Argentine immigration officer at the time of entry (typically 60-180 days). Travelers in this category who overstay will be required to obtain an Argentine passport to depart. Children under 18 years of age who reside in Argentina, regardless of nationality, are required to present a notarized document that certifies both parents' permission for the child's departure from Argentina when the child is traveling alone, with only one parent, or in someone else's custody (click on international parental child abduction for more information). The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires cannot assist travelers with obtaining Brazilian or Paraguayan visas. For more information, see the Country Specific Information for Brazil and Paraguay .

The information below concerning driving in Australia is provided for general reference only and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "Traffic operates on the left side of the road, and all vehicles use right-hand drive. Please use caution when crossing streets and when driving. When crossing roads on foot, make sure you look carefully in all directions. Wearing a seat belt is mandatory, and fines apply for not wearing them. Speed limits and laws regarding driving while intoxicated are rigorously enforced, and random breath testing of a driver's blood alcohol limit is a common occurrence. Roads and streets are frequently narrower and less graded than U.S. highways. Outside major metropolitan areas, most highways are two-lane roads with significant distances between destinations. Speed limits vary throughout Australia and are measured in kilometers, not miles. Be aware that speed cameras are everywhere and you will be ticketed for driving over the speed limit.",
      "When driving in Australia, exercise caution while passing or merging with adjacent traffic. If driving in rural areas, be cautious of free-roaming animals, such as kangaroos, and &quot;road-trains&quot; (several semi-truck trailers connected together). Passing road-trains is dangerous, and you should pull over to allow on-coming road-trains to pass to avoid being sideswiped. A number of fatalities have occurred in the Northern Territory where vehicles driven at high rates of speed have skidded and overturned after hitting loose gravel on the shoulder of the road. If you have no experience with a 4-wheel drive vehicle, you should exercise common-sense when driving in the Australian outback.",
      "Texting or holding your phone while driving is against the law in Australia, but you can use a hands-free system to communicate while driving. For specific information concerning Australian driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, mandatory insurance, and the rental and operation of motor vehicles in Australia, visit the Australian Tourist Commission website .",

In some places, it is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, such as inside certain areas of Australian airports, near prisons, and at military bases. If you break local laws in Australia, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not where you are going.

You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",

Australia has and enforces laws prohibiting discrimination for access of premises, facilities, and accommodation; however, please keep in mind that many of the downtown areas of Australian cities were built in the 1800s. These cities often have narrow sidewalks crowded with pedestrians and tourists. Also, many of the tourist spots at the beach or in the outback may have varying degrees of accessibility. Generally, most public transit means, parking, streets, and buildings are accessible to disabled travelers.

Like the United States, Australia shares its national threat levels with the general public to keep everyone informed and to explain the context for the various increased security measures. Australia has an alert system for possible terrorist attacks. The threat levels range from “not expected” to “certain.” The Australian Attorney General's Office website has up-to-date information regarding the current terrorism threat level.

Demonstrations and political rallies are generally approved by local authorities and well publicized. However, even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence.

      "Anecdotal evidence suggested LGBT persons faced discrimination in employment, housing, and access to education and health care. Activists suggested that while many individuals lived open LGBT lifestyles, disapprobation by police officers and societal discrimination against LGBT persons occurred. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance . Access to buildings, pedestrian paths and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with disabilities. Sidewalks (if they exist) are very uneven and will only occasionally have ramps at intersections. Pedestrian crossings are also very infrequent and can be poorly marked. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations for disabled persons. The Town and Country Planning Department set provisions for all public buildings to include accessibility to persons with disabilities. As a result, many new buildings have ramps, reserved parking, and special sanitary facilities for such persons. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .",

The information below concerning Botswana is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "Driving in Botswana is challenging and motorists must drive defensively. As elsewhere in the region, traffic circulates on the left in Botswana. While the roads in major population centers are generally good, rural roads can be in poor condition and treacherous. Rolling power outages mean that many traffic lights and street lamps do not work properly. Approach traffic lights with caution; even when operational drivers should first visually confirm that they are clear to proceed after a light has turned green as opposing traffic frequently continues well after a red light. The combination of long, tedious stretches of two-lane highways without shoulders, high speed limits, free-range domestic animals (even in urban centers), and large numbers of pedestrians and hitchhikers in the roadways make fatal accidents a frequent occurrence.",
      "Smash and grab robberies from vehicles are not uncommon in Botswana, particularly in urban areas at traffic lights. Motorists should avoid carrying anything of value (hand bags, briefcases, purses, cell phones, etc.) in the passenger compartment that could attract potential assailants.",

Adequately equipped emergency rooms and trained physicians are available in the capital but services are rudimentary elsewhere. Professional private emergency rescue services operate air and ground ambulances throughout the country, but care is rendered only after a patient’s ability to pay is established. Response times are often slow in less populated areas. Outside of Gaborone, most airports are either not equipped or may have malfunctioning night lighting capability, so airborne medical evacuations can often only be conducted during daylight hours. Malaria is prevalent only in the north of the country, particularly around the Chobe and Okavango National Parks. Malaria prophylaxis is not required in Gaborone but is highly recommended for travel north of the Tropic of Capricorn. For advanced care U.S. citizens often choose to travel to South Africa. Many South African manufactured prescription drugs are available in Gaborone.",
      "In many areas of Botswana (including Gaborone), tap water can be unsafe and should be avoided or boiled for at least one minute before drinking. Bottled water and beverages are believed to be safe. However, visitors should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Ice may also come from tap water and should be avoided.",

Travelers are advised to exercise appropriate precautions if engaging in sexual activity, or if exposed to blood products through injuries or rendering assistance to accident victims.",

Several hundred cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have been identified in Botswana since January 2004 when Botswana first obtained the ability to test for this form of TB.

U.S. citizens are also urged to be aware of how power outages might affect home security systems, garage doors and gates, and kitchen equipment, such as stoves and refrigerators. The power fluctuations could cause power surges that might harm computers, televisions, or other electrical appliances. Botswana is experiencing a drought and the Water Utilities Corporation is rationing water up to three times a week for eight hours a day in Gaborone and other areas. Check the Water Utilities Corporation Commission website for schedules.",
      "Botswana strictly enforces its laws controlling the trade in animal products, often by means of spot checks for illegal products on roadways or airports. In November 2012, Botswana announced a suspension of commercial hunting in public or private controlled hunting areas which went into effect on January 1, 2014. Botswana's Wildlife Conservation and National Parks Act makes it illegal to possess or remove from Botswana without a government permit any living or dead animal or animal trophy. A trophy is any horn, ivory, tooth, tusk, bone, claw, hoof, hide, skin, hair, feather, egg, or other durable portion of an animal, whether the item has been processed or not. Curio shops and vendors throughout the country sell items such as animal skins, plain and decorated ostrich eggs and eggshells, and carved bones or teeth of animals protected by this law. All of the souvenirs, although widely sold, are subject to this act. Travelers departing the country with a trophy must have a receipt from a store licensed to sell such items. Ivory and endangered rhinoceros horn products obtained in Botswana may not be removed from the country under any circumstances; elephant hair jewelry may be removed only with the appropriate license from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. Trophies may not be taken from the wild without a permit. Violators are subject to arrest and may face a penalty of up to five years imprisonment and a substantial fine.",
      "Wild animals may pose a danger to tourists. Tourists should bear in mind that, even in the most serene settings, the animals are wild and can pose a threat to life and safety. Tourists should use common sense when approaching wildlife, observe all local or park regulations, and heed all instructions given by tour guides. In addition, tourists are advised that potentially dangerous areas sometimes lack fences and warning signs. Exercise appropriate caution in all unfamiliar surroundings.",

Generally police do not target same-sex activity, and historically the law has not been enforced. While the Embassy is unaware of any official reports of violence against persons based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, there is discrimination and stigma against LGBT persons, particularly in villages and rural areas outside the capital.

Petty street crime and crimes of opportunity, primarily the theft of money and personal property, are common. Home invasions, “smash and grabs” from vehicles, cell phone thefts, and muggings - often at knife point, are routinely reported to the police. Hotels and lodges are not immune from criminal activity, and visitors should remain alert and take reasonable precautions in safeguarding personal property (particularly money and electronic equipment). Crime is not only prevalent in urban areas but also in game parks and nature reserves both frequented by tourists and more remote areas. Do not walk at night and avoid walking alone during the day. Visitors are urged to exercise extreme caution near the Gaborone Dam and Kgale Hill in Gaborone due to the high number of reported criminal incidents. If confronted by an armed individual, promptly comply. Resistance will likely result in severe injury.",

As a precaution, all travelers to or through South Africa should carry their original yellow card. Letters, scans, copies, or faxes regarding prior yellow fever vaccination will not be accepted. While this requirement may not be consistently applied, travelers who cannot present an original and currently valid yellow card upon request may be refused entry into or transit through South Africa.

      "Rental motorbikes are readily available, and the required helmet is provided. However, visitors should carefully consider the significant risks of riding a motorbike. Motorbikes provide the greatest road peril in Bermuda; local operators tend to abuse the speed limit and will often pass on the left or right side with no warning. Those unfamiliar with driving on the left side are likely to find the roundabouts and regulations for yielding at junctions confusing and dangerous. In addition, vehicles often stop on the side of the road, blocking one lane of traffic. Main roads, while generally in good condition, are extremely narrow and tend to be bordered by heavy vegetation or stone walls. Taxis are readily available.

The maximum speed limit on Belgian highways is 120 kilometers (72 miles) per hour, but is not always posted. The maximum speed in urban areas is 50 km (30 miles) per hour, but in central Brussels it is 30 km (19 miles) per hour. While Belgian authorities strictly enforce speed limits , many Belgians still drive significantly faster than the posted limit. Claiming ignorance of the speed limit may not prevent you from getting a significant fine for speeding, and your vehicle may be impounded if you can’t pay the fine on the spot. Belgian police also conduct breath analysis checks for alcohol use , particularly at night and during major holidays. The legal limit for operating a motor vehicle is .05 percent blood alcohol content. You must use your seat belt while driving in a vehicle. Bicycling is very common in Belgium, for both recreational and more traditional transportation purposes. It is strongly advised to wear helmets at all times.",

You should always drive defensively and be alert to cars pulling out in front of you from side streets. Local practice is to allow this on an individual basis. It is not uncommon to see poorly maintained or excessively loaded vehicles on roadways. Rural roads can be narrow, winding, and in poor condition. Road flooding occurs frequently in many areas, including Nassau and Freeport, during and after rainstorms. Drivers should be alert for unmarked or poorly marked construction zones. Traffic Laws: It is the law that all drivers and their passengers wear seat belts while riding in a vehicle in The Bahamas. Wearing helmets while riding on a scooter or motorbike is also compulsory. Public Transportation: Public transportation is available by minibus (referred to as jitneys) and taxi. Jitneys do not only stop at designated stops and do so without warning.

Crime in Grand Bahama has increased this past year. Criminal activity on the outlying family islands does occur, but to a much lesser degree than on New Providence or Grand Bahama. Armed robbery and sexual assault are major criminal threats facing U.S. citizens in New Providence. The U.S. Embassy has received multiple reports indicating tourists have been robbed at gunpoint or knifepoint in tourist locations in the downtown areas of Nassau; several of these incidents occurred during daylight hours. The U.S. Embassy has received reports of sexual assaults in tourist areas as well. The Bahamas has one of the highest incidences of sexual assault in the Caribbean, according to 2012 United Nations report. The majority of sexual assaults reported occurred after excessive consumption of alcohol. The loss of ability to remember facts and details due to alcohol consumption makes prosecution of sexual assaults more difficult. For the latest security messages , visit our website. The Bahamas, due to its numerous uninhabited islands and cays, has historically been favored by smugglers and pirates. As a tourist, you would not have noticeable interaction with organized crime elements; however, persons operating on their own in boats or planes should be alert to the possibility of encountering similar craft operated by smugglers. Terrorism: The threat of terrorism is low, but you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks which could take place in public areas, including places frequented by travelers.

Additionally, the Immigration Act prohibits “homosexual” persons from entering the country, but immigration authorities have not enforced that law.

There continues to be significant hostile sentiment towards individuals who identify themselves as LGBTI. Tourist friendly areas, including San Pedro Town, Ambergris Caye, remain relatively open and welcoming to the LGBTI community.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Benin, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance. With the exception of the road linking Cotonou in the south to Malanville on the border with Niger in the north, roads in Benin are generally in poor condition and are often impassable during the rainy season. Benin's unpaved roads vary widely in quality; deep sand and potholes are common. During the rainy season from mid-June to mid-September, dirt roads often become impassable. Four-wheel drive vehicles with full spare tires and emergency equipment are recommended. Most of the main streets in Cotonou are paved, but side streets are often made of dirt and have deep potholes. Traffic moves on the right, as in the United States. Cotonou has a very limited public transportation system; many Beninese people rely on bicycles, mopeds, motorbikes, and zemidjans. U.S. Embassy personnel are required to wear safety helmets when on a motorcycle and are prohibited from using zemidjans. Travelers using zemidjans, particularly at night, are much more vulnerable to being mugged, assaulted, or robbed. Buses and bush taxis offer service in the interior. Maintenance and operation of public transportation may fall significantly below U.S. safety standards. Gasoline smuggled from Nigeria is widely available in glass bottles and jugs at informal roadside stands throughout Cotonou and much of the country. This gasoline is of unreliable quality, often containing water or other contaminants that can damage or disable your vehicle. Drivers should purchase fuel only from official service stations. There are periodic gas shortages, which can be particularly acute in the north of the country where there are few service stations. U.S. citizens traveling by road should exercise extreme caution. Poorly maintained and overloaded transport and cargo vehicles frequently break down and cause accidents. Drivers often place branches or leaves in the road to indicate a broken down vehicle is in the roadway. Undisciplined drivers move unpredictably through traffic. Construction work is often poorly indicated. Speed bumps, commonly used on paved roads in and near villages, are seldom indicated. Drivers must be on guard against people and livestock wandering into or across the roads. Nighttime driving is particularly hazardous as vehicles frequently lack headlights and/or taillights, and brake lights are often burned out. With few exceptions, Cotonou and other cities lack street lighting, and lighting on roads between population centers is non-existent. The U.S. Embassy in Cotonou prohibits non-essential travel outside of metropolitan areas after dusk by diplomatic personnel and strongly urges all U.S. citizens to avoid night driving as well. There have been numerous carjackings and robberies on roads in Benin after dark, several of which resulted in murder when the driver refused to comply with the assailants' demands. The national police periodically conduct vehicle checks at provisional roadblocks in an effort to improve road safety and reduce the increasing number of carjackings. When stopped at such a roadblock, you must have all of the vehicle's documentation available to present to the authorities. Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information.",

Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses.

While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested in a foreign country, that might not always be the case. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas.",

Local social norms favor discretion in sexual relations and are not uniformly accepting of same-sex relationships. For further information on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) travel, please read our LGBT Traveler Information page.",
      "ACCESSIBILITY: While in Benin, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is available in the United States. The condition of the sidewalks, where they exist, is often poor. It is unusual to find curb cuts or other modifications for wheelchairs. Cars and motorcycles often park on sidewalks, making navigation difficult. Only major roads are paved. The unpaved roads may be full of holes, rocks, and other debris. There are few marked pedestrian crossings. Some hotels, restaurants, and other stores are accessible via wheelchair, but many are not. The primary method of public transportation is the zemidjan (moped taxi). The passenger rides on the back and there are no special accommodations for people with disabilities. Discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities is not prohibited by law, and there are no legal requirements for the construction or alteration of buildings to permit access for persons with disabilities.

Swimming conditions along Benin’s coastline are notoriously dangerous due to strong and changeable tides, waves, and rip currents. There is no safe way to determine whether conditions on any given day are suitable for entering the water, in part because waves and rip currents can develop and intensify abruptly.

      "CRIME: Street crime is a significant problem in Cotonou. Robbery and muggings occur along the Boulevard de France (the beach road by the Marina and Novotel Hotels), on the beaches near hotels frequented by international visitors, and within the Haie Vive and Les Cocotiers neighborhoods (where many bars and restaurants frequented by expatriates are located), in addition to other parts of the city. Most of the reported incidents involve the use of force, often by armed persons, with occasional minor injury to the victim. Travelers should avoid isolated and poorly lit areas and should not walk around the city or the beaches between dusk and dawn. U.S. diplomatic personnel are prohibited from visiting the Dantokpa market between the hours of dusk and dawn. Even during daylight hours, foreigners on the beach near Cotonou are frequently the victims of robberies. When visiting the beach, you should not carry valuables, and should carry only a photocopy of your passport. If you are a victim of crime, you should contact the U.S. Embassy immediately. There has been a continued increase in the number of robberies after dark, both within metropolitan Cotonou and on highways and rural roads outside of major metropolitan areas. Motorists are urged to be wary of the risk of carjacking in both urban and rural areas. Keep the windows of your vehicle rolled up and the doors locked, and stay alert for signs of suspicious behavior by other motorists or pedestrians that may lead to carjacking, such as attempts to stop a moving vehicle for no obvious reason. Motorists should be aware of obstacles or obstructions, such as a branches, tires, or ropes, that would-be robbers place in the roadway in an effort to ambush victims. Travelers should avoid driving outside the city of Cotonou after dark and should exercise extreme caution when driving inside of Cotonou after dark (see Traffic Safety and Road Conditions below). Overland travel to Nigeria is dangerous near the Benin/Nigeria border due to unofficial checkpoints and highway banditry. You should exercise extreme caution when using credit cards and automated teller machines (ATMs) in Benin due to a high rate of fraud. Perpetrators of business and other kinds of fraud often target foreigners, including U.S. citizens. While such fraud schemes in the past have been largely associated with Nigeria, they are now prevalent throughout West Africa, including Benin, and are more frequently perpetrated by Beninese criminals. Business scams are not always easy to recognize, and any unsolicited business proposal should be carefully scrutinized. There are, nevertheless, some indicators that are warnings of a probable scam. Look out for:",

      "These scams, which may appear to be legitimate business deals requiring advance payments on contracts, pose a danger of both financial loss and physical harm. Recently, U.S. citizens have been increasingly targeted. The perpetrators of such scams sometimes pose as attorneys. One common ploy is to request fees for “registration” with fictitious government offices or regulatory authorities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim of advance-fee fraud is common sense – if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. Travelers should carefully check out any unsolicited business proposal originating in Benin before committing funds, providing goods or services, or undertaking travel.

If you spot any suspected pirates, do not approach them; immediately contact port officials, local police, and the U.S. Embassy.",

      "Both organized and spontaneous demonstrations are infrequent in Belarus, though they can occur authorities rarely allow groups to hold legal demonstrations, despite their applying for permits to assemble. Localized street disturbances relating to political events are much more likely in Minsk or larger cities, than smaller towns and villages. In some instances, authorities may use force to disperse demonstrators, including peaceful ones. Bystanders, including foreign nationals, may face the possibility of arrest, beating, or detention. Demonstrations intended to be peaceful can sometimes become confrontational. For this reason, it is recommended that U.S. citizens avoid all demonstrations and protest gatherings. Security personnel may at times place foreigners under surveillance; hotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with authorities; these sites are not always clearly marked and application of these restrictions is subject to interpretation.",

      "CRIME: Belarus has a moderate rate of street crime. Criminal activity in Minsk is comparable to the level found in other large cities, while in the rural areas it is very limited. Though violent crime against foreigners is rare, criminals have been known to use force if met with resistance from victims. Common street crime, such as mugging and pocket picking, occurs most frequently near public transportation venues, near hotels frequented by foreigners, and/or at night in poorly-lighted areas. In Minsk, you should be especially alert in metro and bus stations.",

Prostitutes at hotels may attempt to open hotel room doors in search of customers. Local and transnational organized criminal activity exists in Belarus. Most casinos and adult clubs are operated by criminal elements, but street-level organized criminal violence is rare and does not generally affect foreigners. Carjacking is also rare, but theft of vehicle parts and car vandalism is not. Sport-utility and luxury vehicles tend to be the most sought-after.

In some cases, visas may be issued at the airport. Check the Embassy of Belarus webpage for additional visa information. . All U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Belarus are required to register with the local office of the Citizenship and Migration Department of the Ministry of Interior (formerly OVIR) within 5 business days of arrival; travelers are not required to register if they plan to spend no more than 7 calendar days (5 working days and a weekend) in Belarus. The registration fee for a temporary stay (up to 90 days) is approximately USD$7 (the exact amount can be calculated by taking half of one National Minimum Tariff Unit. (The dollar amount is calculated here against the current exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble. This may change and travelers should check the Belarusian Embassy website for the most up to date information.). Registration fees for temporary residence (over 90 days within a year) and permanent residence (residence permit for up to 3 years) are currently about $40 each (three National Minimum Tariff Units. Again, the dollar amount is calculated here against the current exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble. This may change and travelers should again check the Belarusian Embassy website for the most up to date information.). Failure to register can result in fines and difficulties when departing. If you plan to stay at a hotel, you will be automatically registered at check-in. Registration performed by a hotel is free of charge.",
      "Visas: Visa validity dates are strictly enforced; travelers should request a visa of sufficient length to allow for changes in arrival and departure plans, and should carefully review the beginning and ending dates of their visa before traveling. Beginning in June 2014, Belarus made health insurance policy a condition on which a Belarusian entry visa can be issued. Visa requests will not be considered without a valid health insurance. Belarus accepts health insurance policies issued by foreign insurance companies, provided Belarus is covered by those policies. The minimum coverage amount is €10,000. An original or a copy of the policy (either one) must be submitted to the consular officer at the time of visa application as proof of purchase. The policy should cover the duration of the applicant’s stay in country. Authorities at the port of entry will not require the insurance policy to be presented at time of entry into the country. However, the U.S. Embassy in Minsk recommends travelers carry a copy of the policy with them at that time. Travelers or their sponsors in Belarus may purchase health insurance from a Belarusian provider.",
      "Airport visas: In some cases travelers may obtain Belarusian visas upon arrival at the Minsk International Airport. An inviting person must submit all required visa support paperwork to the Minsk International Airport Consular office no later than two workdays prior to the visitor’s arrival. Upon arrival, the traveler will be required to complete the visa application form (which can be completed and printed out in advance) and attach one photo of 35X45 mm size. Airport visas are issued prior to immigration control checkpoint at the airport. Please be aware that a consular officer at the airport has the authority to refuse the visa application without explanation. In this case, the traveler will be deported from Belarus and the visa fee will not be refunded.",

Long-term residents (more than 90 days a year) or students must obtain an HIV/AIDS test in Belarus and submit the results to the Department of Citizenship and Migration when applying for an extension of stay or residency in Belarus.",
      "Exit Visa: A valid exit visa is necessary to depart Belarus. Generally, the visa issued by a Belarusian embassy or consulate is valid for both entry and exit. Photocopies of visas may be helpful in the event of loss, but note that a copy of a visa will not be sufficient for entry or departure, as Belarusian border officials always require original travel documents. If a traveler overstays their visa’s validity -- even by one day -- they will be prevented from leaving until they have been granted an extension by the Department of Citizenship and Migration. If the traveler is not in a possession of a valid visa, they will face delays in leaving Belarus and may have trouble finding adequate accommodation. By Belarusian law, foreign travelers with an expired visa may not check in at any hotel or other lodging establishment. If a traveler enters Belarus on a short term visa (up to 90 days) which has since expired and the traveler obtains a temporary residency permit to extend the stay (this is typical in cases of work and student visas), the traveler must also obtain an exit-entry visa from the Immigration Office of the Ministry of Interior at the place they registered in Belarus in order to enable the traveler to leave and re-enter the country during his/her stay on a temporary residency permit. The immigration office that issues a temporary residency permit is normally the one that would issue an entry-exit visa.",
      "The Embassy advises that a transit visa is required for those who plan to travel through Belarus to other countries. Travelers are advised that there is a transit-visa requirement for entering and leaving Belarus. Transit visas are required even for those transiting on a direct overnight train with no stops or transfers on Belarusian territory. Transit visas should be obtained prior to any journey that requires travel through Belarus. Transit visas are good only for transiting from Belarus to another country. Depending on travel plans, the traveler should make sure they request an appropriate number of entries for a transit visa. Transit visas can be single-, double-, or multi-entry, but with no more than 48 hours of stay permitted in country per entry. If a traveler attempts to reenter the country from which they originally entered, using an invalid or expired transit visa, they will not be allowed to exit Belarus without paying a fine and obtaining an exit visa. Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Russian visas are not a substitute for the transit visa. Many travel agencies, including those in Russia and CIS countries, as well as train ticket sales personnel, are often not aware of this visa requirement and may not seek a transit visa for a traveler unless instructed by the traveler to do so.",
      "U.S. citizens attempting to transit Belarus without a valid Belarusian transit visa have been denied entry into the country and forcibly removed from trains. In some instances, local border and railway authorities have threatened passengers who did not possess a valid transit visa with jail or extorted “fines.” It is the Embassy’s recommendation that a traveler not pay any border or railway officials for transit visas or “transit-visa fines,” as these officials are not authorized to issue such visas. If a traveler is in Belarus without a transit visas, and is confronted by border or train personnel, they should request to be put in contact with consular officials at the U.S. Embassy in Minsk.",
      "If a travel route to Belarus goes through Russia, then the traveler must possess a Russian transit visa in addition to a Belarusian visa. Russian embassies outside of the United States, including the Russian Embassy in Belarus, generally do not issue transit or tourist visas to U.S. citizens. Russian transit visas are not normally obtainable at Russian airports. For more information, please check the Consular Information Sheet on Russia.",
      "Limitations on Length of Stay: The Law on the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens and Stateless Persons in the Republic of Belarus states that all foreign citizens may be granted permission for a temporary stay (up to 90 days in a calendar year counted from first entry), temporary residence (over 90 days up to one year), or permanent residence (up to three years). Belarusian embassies and consulates will issue visas for temporary stays only. A temporary stay visa will allow a traveler to be present physically in Belarus for a maximum of 90 days in a calendar year in which the visa is issued. Once they have spent 90 days in Belarus, at one time or through a combination of visits, they will not be eligible to receive another visa through the end of that calendar year.",
      "If a traveler receives a visa for a temporary stay, but wishes to remain in Belarus for longer than 90 days, they must apply for temporary or permanent residence with the Ministry of Interior. The application must be made in Belarus within the 90 days allotted for a temporary stay. Permission for temporary residence can be granted to students, spouses, or close relatives of Belarusian citizens, or for “work, business, or other activities.” Travelers may contact the Consular Section at the U.S. Embassy in Minsk for more information about application procedures for temporary or permanent residence. Please note that the Embassy cannot make these arrangements for travelers. Every non-Belarusian entering Belarus is required to fill out a migration card. Travelers should retain this card for the period of stay and present it to the border authorities when exiting Belarus.",
      "As a foreign citizen without a valid Belarusian visa, migration card, or proper registration with the Department of Citizenship and Migration as a temporary visitor or resident, travelers can be subject to sanctions up to and including administrative arrest and subsequent deportation under the provisions of the Code of Administrative Offenses. Depending on the circumstances, as a deportee, a traveler may also be banned from returning to Belarus for a period from one to ten years.",
      "Visiting and transiting Belarus, a traveler should also be prepared to demonstrate sufficient financial means to support their stay. For individuals staying in Belarus less than one month, this amount is equal to two National Minimum Tariffs (approximately $25/day/person). For those staying for longer than one month, the requirements call for an amount equal to 50 National Minimum Tariffs (about $580/month/person). Belarusian officials may request this proof of funds at the time of visa application, at the border, or during registration. According to the Ministry of Interior, cash, credit cards, paid hotel reservations, or a letter from an inviting party pledging full financial support are sufficient means to demonstrate financial wherewithal.",
      "When entering Belarus, a traveler may be charged 4 Euros per kilogram of luggage in excess of 50 Kg (121 lbs). That fee must be paid in dollars or Euros. Additionally, the aggregate value of goods transferred (exclusive personal effects) may not exceed the equivalent of €1,500 for ground borders and €10,000 for air borders. In accordance with current customs regulations, a traveler may enter Belarus and exit the country with up to $10,000 in cash without submitting a written declaration. For additional information on customs rules for Belarus, please see the Belarusian State Customs Committee official website .",
      "Belarus enforces a requirement for special permits to travel in “limited entry border zones.” The Government of Belarus has not provided information defining the parameters of those zones. Generally, such zones are drawn in close proximity to the country borders and require special permissions for entry. Permission is issued in advance by the State Border Guards Committee. Travelers should be alert for warning signs, road barriers, and/or border guard posts, and are advised not to cross into such areas without permission.",
      "Religious Group Travel: Foreign missionaries may not engage in religious activities outside the institutions that invited them unless they have a religious worker visa. One-year validity, multiple-entry, &quot;spiritual-activities&quot; visas, which are required of foreign missionaries, can be difficult to get, even for faiths that are registered with the government and have a long history in the country. Approval often involves a difficult bureaucratic process.",
      "Belarusian law requires all religious groups and organizations to register with the government; most organizations have done so. Unregistered religious groups may not legally gather for religious purposes. Many unregistered groups continue to meet, however, leaving themselves vulnerable to selective implementation of the law by authorities. The law also stipulates that only Belarusian citizens can head religious organizations in Belarus. In recent years, authorities have harassed, warned, fined, and briefly detained members of some unregistered and so-called &quot;non-traditional&quot; faiths for engaging in unsanctioned worship or proselytism. U.S. Embassy Minsk strongly recommends that should the traveler choose to attend a religious service of an unregistered religious group, they do so only after consulting with members of the group about the risk of harassment or possible arrest by local law enforcement authorities. Travelers are also urged to contact U.S. Embassy Minsk in the event they encounter any problems with authorities due to your participation in such services or events.",
      "Departure Restrictions: A list of foreigners whose travel OUT OF Belarus is restricted was introduced in 2012. A non-Belarusian may be added to this list if they have unresolved tax issues in Belarus, have debts to the government or are a defendant in a criminal or economic crime case.",
      "Driving a car to/through Belarus: Under the current customs regulations, it is illegal to transfer a car registered in the name of a non-resident to a resident of Belarus without paying import tax on it. For example, if a resident of Belarus is pulled over by the local police while driving a car belonging to a foreigner, it is considered that a transfer of the car took place, which can lead to fines, car confiscation, or import tax payment. The foreigner is added to the list of foreigners whose departure from Belarus is restricted until he/she has paid all taxes and duties. (The Embassy is aware of several such cases involving Polish, Moldovan and German nationals who could not leave Belarus, as their cars had been driven by locals and they were not in the car at the time the road police pulled it over. Dual Nationality: A Belarusian citizen who obtains U.S. citizenship through naturalization may not have automatically lost Belarusian citizenship. In the majority of cases, naturalized U.S. citizens retain their Belarusian citizenship unless they take specific steps to renounce it. The Belarusian authorities will allow naturalized U.S. citizens from Belarus to enter the country without a valid Belarusian passport on a “certificate of return” issued by Belarusian embassies and consulates. Please note that a valid Belarusian passport will be required to leave the country. It can take two to four weeks to receive a new Belarusian passport. For additional information, please consult with the Embassy of Belarus in Washington, D.C.",
      "Belarusian citizens, including those who also hold passports from other countries, are subject to Belarusian laws requiring service in Belarus’s armed forces, as well as other laws pertaining to passports and nationality. An individual who holds both U.S. and Belarusian passports and is of military age and does not wish to serve in the Belarusian armed forces should contact the Embassy of Belarus in Washington, D.C. It is important that they learn more about an exemption or deferment from Belarusian military service before going to Belarus. Without this exemption or deferment document, they may not be able to leave Belarus without completing military service, or may be subject to criminal penalties for failure to serve.",
      "Children born to Belarusian parents or to one Belarusian parent and one non-Belarusian parent, even if born in the United States and in possession of a U.S. passport, may not be issued a Belarusian visa for travel to Belarus. The Belarusian Government considers these children to be Belarusian citizens until age 18, when they may choose to reject that claim to citizenship. Instead of a visa, a &quot;certificate of return&quot; is issued that will allow the child to enter Belarus. It is imperative that parents of such children understand that, in order to leave the country, the child will be required to have a Belarusian passport if he/she does not already have one. It can take anywhere from two to four weeks to complete the application procedures and receive a new Belarusian passport.",

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Brazil, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Driving on Brazil's inter-city roads can pose significant risks. As is the case elsewhere in the region, poor driving skills, bad roads, and a high density of traffic combine to make travel via roads considerably more hazardous than in the United States. There are no laws requiring truckers to take mandatory rest stops and they often drive for excessive periods of time. All major inter-city routes are saturated with heavy truck traffic and for the most part have only two lanes. Road maintenance is inadequate and some long-distance roads through the Amazon forest are impassable much of the year. Private cars and public buses are the main modes of inter-city road travel. Buses can range (depending on the route and the price) from luxurious and well-maintained to basic and mechanically unsound. Bus hijacking, usually non-violent, occurs at random. Apart from toll roads, which generally have their own services, roadside assistance is available only very sporadically and informally through local private mechanics. The fastest way to summon assistance in an emergency anywhere in the country is to dial 193, a universal number staffed by local fire departments. This service is in Portuguese only. Many motorists in major urban areas and more developed parts of the country carry cellular phones, and can be asked to call for help in an emergency. Traffic Laws : There are severe penalties for a number of traffic offenses. The information below concerning Brazil is provided for general reference only and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance. Travelers planning on staying for more than 180 days should obtain an Inter-American Driving Permit to carry along with their valid U.S. license if they plan to drive while in Brazil. Such permits can be obtained through AAA or other sources. Brazil requires the use of seatbelts for everyone in the car. Brazilian federal law requires car seats for all children under the age of 7 ½. From age 7 ½ years to 10, children cannot ride in the front seat of the car, and must be in the back seat wearing a seatbelt. Adhere to posted speed limits. Yielding the Right of Way : Drivers must yield the right of way to cars on their right. Compliance with stop signs is rarely enforced, so many motorists treat them as yield signs. Driving Under the Influence: Under Brazil’s Lei Seca (“Dry Law”), drivers with any measurable content of alcohol in their blood are in violation of the law. Checkpoints are often set up in urban areas where randomly chosen drivers are required to exit their vehicles and perform a breathalyzer test. In addition to legal penalties, those found to have any evidence of drinking will have their cars impounded. Local Driving Customs: Drivers often use flashes or wave a hand out of the window to signal other drivers to slow down. In addition, pedestrian &quot;zebra&quot; crossings are strictly observed in some places (especially in Brasilia) and ignored most everywhere else. It is common for drivers to turn across one or more lanes of traffic without warning. Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the website of Brazil’s national tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety .",
      "AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT :The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Brazil’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Brazil’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page .",

Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Brazil to ensure the medication is legal in Brazil. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases are prevalent:",

      "Zika Virus: Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact. The CDC has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects in some fetuses and babies born to infected mothers. For additional information about Zika, including travel advisories, visit the CDC website .",
      "Elective Surgery: Plastic and other elective/cosmetic surgery is a major medical industry in Brazil. Although Brazil has many plastic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you are planning to undergo plastic surgery in Brazil, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available. Some “boutique” plastic surgery operations offer luxurious facilities but are not hospitals and are therefore unable to deal with emergencies. Non-traditional Medicine: Several U.S. citizens have died while visiting non-traditional healers outside of urban areas. U.S. citizens are advised to ensure they have access to proper medical care when visiting such sites. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information:",

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES:",
      "You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES",
      "Water Hazards: Brazil’s beaches can pose a threat to the safety of travelers. Many beaches have very strong and dangerous riptides, including those in Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza. Always observe posted flags and signs warning of strong swells and currents, and never swim while under the influence of alcohol. Even if the water looks safe, there may be strong riptides. Ocean currents and waves are unpredictable, even in popular beaches frequented by tourists. Travelers are advised to adhere to local authorities’ guidance and refrain from swimming alone in areas marked with red warning signs or at beaches where there are no municipal lifeguards or first responder services. There is a possibility of shark attacks in the waters of many of the beaches in northeastern Brazil, including those in Recife, Natal, and Maceio. Heed signs posted on any beach you visit.",
      "Electricity Blackouts: Power failures in large urban centers frequently occur in areas with high concentrations of hotels and residences in cities throughout the country. During these blackouts, local authorities quickly increase police presence to maintain public security. In addition, most tourist hotels are equipped with generators, minimizing the impact of a blackout on visitors. Nonetheless, you should use caution in the event of a blackout during your visit to Brazil. Residents should keep flashlights and sufficient supplies of food and potable water in their residences to prepare for extended blackouts. Natural Disasters: Flooding and mudslides occur throughout the country, and can be fatal. Monitor news and weather reports and adhere to municipal advisories before traveling to areas prone to flooding or landslides. Many of Brazil’s larger cities have frequent heavy rainstorms that have caused flash flooding and crippled traffic for hours. Customs Restrictions: Brazilian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into, or export from, Brazil of items such as firearms, antiquities, mineral samples, tropical plants, medications, and business equipment. In the Amazon region, there is special scrutiny of the export of biological material which could have genetic value. People propagating or exporting biological material without proper permits run the risk of being accused of “biopiracy,” a serious offense in Brazil. Contact the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, D.C. or one of Brazil's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. Please also refer to our information on customs regulations . Death of a U.S. Citizen: In the unfortunate event of a death, relatives or friends of any deceased U.S. citizen should contact the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia or one of the U.S. Consulates General in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, or Recife before contracting with a local mortuary. We can issue a Consular Report of Death Abroad and help repatriate the deceased to the United States. RIGHTS OF LGBTI INDIVIDUALS: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Brazil. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. ACCESSIBILITY : While in Brazil, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. Brazilian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, and access to health care. The federal government effectively enforces these provisions and requires priority be given to these individuals. Although federal and state laws have provisions ensuring access to buildings for persons with disabilities, states do not have programs to enforce them effectively. Accessibility to public transportation and the ability to accommodate the needs of physically disabled persons are limited in most areas."

      "CRIME: Brazilian police and media report that violent crime rate remains high in most urban centers. Credit card fraud and ATM scams are endemic in Brazil. Visitors should work closely with their financial institutions to monitor their accounts regularly for undocumented withdrawals or charges. Brasilia: Brasilia has high rates of crime. Residential burglaries continue to occur in the generally affluent residential sections of the city. Public transportation, hotel sectors, and tourist areas report the highest crime rates, but statistics show that these incidents can happen anywhere and at any time. The “satellite cities” that surround Brasilia have per-capita crime rates comparable to much larger cities. Police reports indicate that rates of all types of crime, including “quicknappings,” have risen dramatically in Brasilia in the last two years. Brasilia’s Central Bus Station, or “Rodoviaria,” is a particularly dangerous area, especially at night. This location is known to have a large concentration of drug dealers and users. Rio de Janeiro: The city continues to experience high incidences of crime, including armed robberies. Crime can happen at any place or time within Rio. While criminal activity is more frequent in certain areas, there is no area in Rio that is immune. Tourists are particularly vulnerable to street thefts and robberies in the evening and at night especially in areas adjacent to major tourist attractions. If robbed, do not attempt to resist or fight back, but rather relinquish your personal belongings. Always, pay close attention to your surroundings and the behavior of those nearby. There have been reports of thieves and rapists slipping incapacitating drugs into drinks at bars, hotel rooms, and street parties. While crime occurs throughout the year, it is more frequent during Carnival and the weeks prior. When choosing lodging, consider location, security, and the availability of a safe to store valuables. Do not answer your hotel room door until you positively confirm who is on the other side. U.S. government personnel in Brazil are prohibited from traveling to Rio’s “unpacified” favelas but may visit Rio’s pacified favelas after obtaining permission from the Consulate’s security office (“pacification” is a law enforcement and social services program designed to reduce lawlessness in Rio’s “favelas,” or slums). However, even pacified favelas can be unpredictable and dangerous, and U.S. residents and visitors in Rio de Janeiro who visit pacified favelas could be placing themselves at risk.Be vigilant while on the roads, especially at night. There have been shootings and carjackings on the Linha Vermelha that links the international airport to the popular tourist areas in the city’s Southern Zone. In Rio de Janeiro, motorists should be especially vigilant at stoplights and when stuck in traffic. Carjackings and holdups can occur at intersections and in tunnels. Crime on public transportation is frequent, and at times is violent. When traveling by taxi, tourists should only use taxis openly displaying company information and phone numbers, as well as red license plates. U.S. government employees are not permitted to use public vans and tourists are advised to avoid them as well. Rio de Janeiro is also often the site of large scale events such as the upcoming 2016 Olympics. Reselling tickets to these types of sporting events may be seen as scalping and result in arrest. During the 2014 World Cup the police apprehended numerous people for scalping tickets, some spending extensive time in prison waiting for trial. Report all incidents to Rio's tourist police (DEAT) at (21) 2332-2924. The tourist police have been very responsive to victims. Sao Paulo: All areas of Greater Sao Paulo have a high rate of armed robbery of pedestrians and drivers at stoplights and during rush hour traffic. The downtown area and outskirts of the city are subject to higher levels of crime. The &quot;red light districts&quot; of Sao Paulo, located on Rua Augusta north of Avenida Paulista and the Estacao de Luz metro area, are especially dangerous. There are regular reports of women drugging men's drinks and robbing them while they are unconscious. Armed holdups of pedestrians and motorists by motorcyclists are a common occurrence in Sao Paulo. Criminals also target restaurants throughout the city, frequently between the hours of 10:00 pm and 4:00 am, including the upscale neighborhoods of Jardins, Itaim Bibi, Campo Belo, Morumbi and Moema. Victims who resist run the risk of violent attack. Be aware of your surroundings and exercise caution at all times. Respect police roadblocks and be aware that some municipal services may be disrupted. Due to some recent violent attacks (including sexual assaults) at Ibirapuera Park, the U.S. Government has advised all Consulate personnel to avoid the park after dark. Favela tours have recently become popular among foreign tourists in Sao Paulo. Avoid Sao Paulo’s favelas as neither the tour company nor the city police can guarantee your safety when entering favelas.",
      "The São Paulo Tourist Police (Delegacia de Protecao ao Turista) numbers are 11-3120-4447 and 3151-4167.",
      "Recife : Tourists in Recife should take special care while on the beaches, as robberies may occur in broad daylight. In the upscale Boa Viagem neighborhood, carjackings can occur at any time of the day or night. VICTIMS OF CRIME: If you or another U.S. citizen becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can:",
      "Replace a stolen passport. Help you find appropriate medical care if you are the victim of violent crimes such as assault or rape. Put you in contact with the appropriate police authorities, and if you want us to, contact family members or friends.

      "The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Brazil is divided between three services: 190 - Policia (Police), 192- Ambulancia (Ambulance), and 193- Bombeiros (Fire Department).",
      "Please see our information for victims of crime , including possible victim compensation programs in the United States. Demonstrations: Demonstrations and political/labor strikes are common in urban areas, may cause temporary disruption to public and private transportation, and could become violent. Even demonstrations or events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Brazil are advised to take common-sense precautions, avoid large gatherings or other events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate or protest, and comply with the instructions of local authorities. Check the website of the Embassy or consulate nearest you for current information on demonstrations. Cross-Border Criminal Activities: Individuals with ties to criminal entities and traffickers operate along Brazilian borders. U.S. citizens crossing into bordering countries should consult the Country Specific Information on the relevant nation. Restricted Areas for U.S. Government Employees: Due to concerns about violent crime , U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to any of the unpacified favelas in Brasilia, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo. Pacified favelas in Rio are discussed above. This restriction does not include commonly used routes that pass near or through favelas. In addition, U.S. government employees are not permitted to visit any areas within 150 km of the international borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay (This policy is NOT intended to limit travel to the Foz do Iguaçu National Park or Pantanal National Park). Travel is also restricted between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. in Brasilia’s “satellite cities” of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa.",

      "Brazil requires U.S. citizens to carry a valid U.S. passport and visa when traveling to Brazil for any purpose. You must obtain your Brazilian visa in advance from the Brazilian Embassy or consulate nearest to your place of residence in the United States. Visas cannot be obtained at the airport, and immigration authorities will refuse entry into Brazil to anyone not possessing a valid visa. The U.S. government cannot assist you if you arrive in Brazil without proper documentation. U.S. citizens and other foreign travelers must fill out an immigration form on arrival that will be stamped and handed back by immigration officials at the airport. It is important to retain this form to hand back to immigration officials upon exit from the country. Special Entry/Exit Requirements for Dual Nationals : U.S. citizens who also have Brazilian nationality cannot be issued Brazilian visas and must obtain a Brazilian passport from the Brazilian Embassy or Consulate nearest to their place of residence to enter and depart Brazil. In addition to being subject to all Brazilian laws affecting U.S. citizens, dual nationals may also be subject to other laws that impose special obligations on Brazilian citizens. Special Entry/Exit Requirements for Minors : Travelers under 18 years of age and their parents should carefully review the visa application requirements. The adjudicating official at the Brazilian Embassy or consulate may require a birth certificate and notarized travel authorization from both parents to issue a visa to a minor. Brazilian minors age 17 years and under, including minors who have both Brazilian and U.S. citizenship, are subject to strict exit requirements. Brazilian minors departing Brazil, if not accompanied by both parents, must prove that both parents authorized the departure. Minors aged 17 years and under who are not Brazilian nationals are not technically subject to the same strict travel requirements as Brazilian minors. However, there have been cases where the travel of non-Brazilian minors has been delayed or prevented when accompanied by only one parent or a third party. We encourage all U.S. citizens considering travel to Brazil to carefully review the Brazilian government’s current visa information . Parents contemplating separation or divorce should resolve custody matters before leaving the country. Pursuant to The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, to which both Brazil and the United States are parties, custody will ultimately be decided by a court in the country where the child is a habitual resident. Information about dual nationality and the prevention of international child abduction can be found on our website.

Traffic lights late at night blink yellow in all directions, leaving the right-of-way unclear and contributing to frequent accidents. Heavy truck traffic creates numerous hazards along the two-lane routes from the Greek border at Kulata going to Sofia, and from the Turkish border at Kapitan Andreevo to Plovdiv. Expect long delays at border crossings. A U.S. state driver's license is only valid in Bulgaria when used in conjunction with an International Driving Permit. If pulled over by a police officer, be aware that under Bulgarian law the police officers may not collect fines on the spot, but may confiscate your driver’s license depending on the offense. Right turns on red lights are not permitted. Keep your headlights on at all times no matter the time of day or weather. At unregulated crossings, the driver on the right has the legal right-of-way, but this rule is frequently ignored. The use of seat belts is mandatory in Bulgaria for all passengers. Children under 10 years of age may ride in the front seat only if seated in a child car seat. Drivers may be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol with a blood level as low as 0.05 percent. The penalties for drivers involved in an accident resulting in injury or death range from a US $25 fine to life imprisonment.",

Do not give your PIN to anyone under any circumstances. Travelers should be suspicious of &quot;instant friends&quot; and should also ask persons claiming to be government officials to provide identification. Police stations may provide translators for anyone who needs to report a crime, but will often require the victim to return at a later time or bring his/her own translator. Pay special attention to the drink prices at high-end bars and nightclubs. Travelers have been charged exorbitant prices, especially for champagne and hard alcohol. Bills have been as high as several thousand dollars for drinks, and in some establishments, the management may use force to secure payment. Use taxis with meters and clearly marked rates displayed on a sticker on the passenger side of the windshield. Taxi drivers are known to overcharge unwary travelers, particularly at Sofia Airport and the Central Train Station. The airport has a clearly marked exit within the arrival terminal that leads travelers to metered taxis at a fair rate and a booth to assist with obtaining taxi services. Finding reputable taxis at the Central Train Station is more difficult. Inquire about the fare before entering a taxi and always account for all luggage, packages, and hand-carried items before paying and releasing a taxi. Automobile theft and break-ins are common in residential areas or in parks. Four-wheel-drive vehicles and late-model European sedans are the most popular targets. Burglary is a common crime.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While travel on most roads is generally safe during the day, travelers must maintain constant vigilance. There have been reports of violent attacks on vehicles traveling the roads throughout the country outside of Bujumbura. Official U.S. government personnel are not allowed to travel without prior approval and are required to carry a satellite phone. Avoid travel on the national highways from dusk to dawn. Drivers without valid permits, and the ease with which a driver's license can be acquired without training, make Burundian drivers less careful, predictable, or mindful of driving rules than U.S. drivers may expect. Although the law provides for the arrest of drunk drivers, in practice, the police do not act on this law. If you are involved in an accident causing death, it is advised that you leave the scene of the accident and proceed to the nearest police station.",
      "Road conditions are poor in both the capital and countryside. There are no functioning traffic signals in Bujumbura, and virtually nothing of the kind elsewhere in the country. Roadways are not marked, and the lack of streetlights or shoulders makes driving in the countryside at night especially dangerous. Additionally, drivers may encounter cyclists, pedestrians, and livestock in the roadway, including in and around the capital. Mini-vans used as buses should be given a wide berth as they start and stop abruptly, often without pulling to the side of the road.",
      "Large holes or damaged portions of roadway are common throughout the country. Vehicles should be equipped with multiple spare tires and recovery equipment. During the rainy season, many side roads are passable only with four-wheel drive vehicles. Burundi’s supplies of gasoline and diesel fuel are imported predominantly from Kenya and Tanzania, and are relatively expensive due to high transportation costs. Service stations are rare outside of the major cities.",
      "Third-party insurance is required, and it will cover any damages in the event of an accident (property, injury, or death). If you are found to have caused an accident, you automatically will be fined 10,000 Burundian francs (approximately $6.50 USD) and your driver's license will be confiscated until the police investigation is completed.",

Military weapons and explosives are readily available to criminals despite authorities’ efforts to collect and destroy such weapons. Armed robberies occur frequently, and foreign residents and visitors, including U.S. citizens, are among the victims. The Embassy has also received reports that residences and hotel rooms of U.S. citizens in Phnom Penh were burglarized while the occupants were asleep.",
      "The most common type of theft is “snatch and grab” robbery, and anything that can be quickly grabbed is at risk: cameras, jewelry, purses, backpacks, mobile phones, etc. Exercise caution and keep belongings out of sight if you travel via “tuk-tuk,” as passengers in these open-air vehicles have been targeted by thieves. If walking along the street, make yourself less of a target by carrying bags or items in your hand or on the shoulder that is furthest from the street. If someone attempts to rob you, you should surrender your valuables immediately, since any perceived resistance may be met with physical violence, including lethal force. The U.S. Embassy frequently receives reports of violent robberies that escalate into fatalities. In September 2013, a U.S. resident was shot in the leg during an armed robbery. In October 2013, a U.S. tourist was killed on the tourist island of Koh Rong off the coast of Sihanoukville. In April 2014, a Dutch resident and her young child were stabbed to death after an intruder entered her home attempting to steal a bicycle.",
      "Pickpockets, some of whom are beggars, are present in the markets and at the tourist sites. Sometimes they may act overly friendly, placing their hand on your shoulder or back to distract you in order to pick your pocket.",
      "To avoid the risk of theft or confiscation of original documents, the U.S. Embassy advises its personnel and all U.S. citizens traveling to, or residing in, Cambodia to carry photocopies of their U.S. passport, driver's license, and other important documents and to leave the originals in a hotel safe or other secure place. Local police rarely investigate reports of crime against tourists, and travelers should not expect to recover stolen items. It has also been reported that some police stations charge foreigners between $20 and $100 to file a police report.",
      "Foreigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of common scams targeting tourists, often involving card games. The Embassy receives many reports of U.S. citizens being approached by individuals in public locations, such as popular shopping malls, and being invited to their homes and end up participating in card games. These are often scams to steal tourists’ money. If you find yourself a victim of one of these scams, you should contact the U.S. Embassy.",
      "See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.",
      "The U.S. Embassy advises its personnel who travel to the provinces outside of Phnom Penh to exercise extreme caution outside the provincial towns at all times. Many rural parts of the country remain without effective policing. Avoid walking alone after dusk anywhere in Sihanoukville, especially along the waterfront. You should be particularly vigilant during annual festivals and at tourist sites in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, where there have been marked increases in motorcycle “snatch and grab” thefts of bags and purses.",
      "If you are visiting Cambodia, you should practice sound personal security awareness by varying your routes and routines, maintaining a low profile, not carrying or displaying large amounts of cash, not wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, and not walking alone after dark. In addition, you should travel by automobile and not use local moto-taxis or cyclos (passenger-carrying bicycles). These vehicles are more vulnerable to armed robberies and offer no protection against injury when involved in traffic accidents.",
      "U.S. citizens are advised not to engage in commercial surrogacy arrangements in Cambodia at this time. In October 2016, the Government of Cambodia issued an official proclamation banning commercial surrogacy in Cambodia. Those with surrogacy cases already in progress should consult a lawyer and contact the U.S. Embassy with any questions. Please keep in mind that U.S. citizens and other foreigners in Cambodia are subject to Cambodian laws and procedures.",

Unexpected road blocks and one-way streets are common and may not be clearly marked. Many visitors hire cars and drivers for long trips through the country.

As of April 2016, the government’s National Mine Action Center estimated 54 km 2 remained to be surveyed and/or cleared in these ten districts. Travelers in these areas should stay on main, heavily traveled roads, and never walk in forested or agricultural areas or in abandoned properties.

Hospitals in major Chinese cities often have VIP wards (gaogan bingfang), which are fairly modern and typically staffed with well-trained English speaking doctors and nurses. However, even in these VIP/foreigner wards, English-speaking patients frequently encounter difficulty due to cultural, language, and regulatory differences. Rural areas have rudimentary facilities and inadequate staffing. Additionally, Rh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain; the blood type of the general Asian populace is Rh positive. Payment and Insurance: Chinese ambulances are often slow to arrive, and most do not have sophisticated medical equipment or trained responders. Cash payment for services is often required prior to treatment, including emergency cases. Travelers will be asked to post a deposit prior to admission to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals in major cities may accept credit cards. The U.S. Embassy and consulates general in China maintain lists of local English-speaking doctors and hospitals . We do not pay medical bills. Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.

Medication: Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with the prescription. Many commonly-used U.S. drugs and medications are not available in China, and counterfeit, low-quality knockoffs are prevalent. If you try to have medications sent to you from outside China, you may have problems getting them released by Chinese Customs and/or you may have to pay high customs duties.

Research your future workplace and make sure that you have the proper work visa to teach in China. Please see the Teaching in China Guide on the U.S. Embassy's website. If you have a serious dispute with your school, consult with a local attorney; and seek assistance from the police if your safety is threatened.",
      "Exit/Travel Bans: Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may result in an exit ban which will prohibit your departure from China until the issue is resolved. Chinese authorities have confirmed that individuals and their family members who are not directly involved or even aware of these proceedings can be subject to an exit ban as well. Additionally, some local businesspeople who feel that they have been wronged by a foreign business partner may hire &quot;debt collectors” to harass, intimidate, and sometimes physically detain foreign business partners or family members in hopes of collecting the debt. The U.S. Embassy or consulate can provide a list of local attorneys who serve U.S. clients, but otherwise are unable to intervene in civil cases. Local law enforcement authorities are generally unwilling to become involved in what they consider private business matters.

      "LGBTI Travelers: Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but there are no civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Prejudices and discrimination still exist in many parts of the country. Same sex marriages are not legally recognized in China and local authorities will not provide marriage certificates to same-sex couples. There are growing LGBTI communities in some of China’s largest cities and violence against LGBTI individuals in China is relatively rare. Non-Governmental Organizations: In January 2017, China will implement a new law regulating the operations of foreign NGOs in China. NGOs and their employees should ensure they are complying with all relevant statutory requirements, particularly if working in sensitive areas or fields. North Korea: China shares a lengthy border with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea or DPRK). We strongly recommend that you not to travel to North Korea. The United States does not have diplomatic relations with the DPRK, and Sweden, the Protecting Power for the United States, can provide only limited consular services. If you cross into North Korea, even inadvertently, you will be subject to North Korean law. For further information, consult the North Korea Country Specific Information webpage and the Travel Warning for North Korea . Persons with Disabilities: U.S. citizens with mobility disabilities may face challenges while traveling in China. Sidewalks often do not have curb cuts and many streets can be crossed only via pedestrian bridges or underpasses accessible by staircase. Assistive technologies for blind people and those with other vision disabilities are unreliable, and access to elevators in public buildings can be restricted. In major cities, public restrooms in places visited by tourists usually have a least one accessible toilet. Piracy: Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. The bootlegs are illegal in the United States and you may also be breaking local law by purchasing them. Political and Religious Activity: Participating in unauthorized political or religious activities, including participating in public protests or sending private electronic messages critical of the government, may result in detention and Chinese government imposed restrictions on future travel to China. U.S. citizens have been detained and expelled for distributing religious literature, including Bibles. If you bring religious literature with you, Chinese law dictates that it be a &quot;reasonable amount” for your personal use. If you attempt to bring larger quantities, the literature will likely be confiscated and you may be fined, detained, or deported. Social Insurance: China has a social insurance system to which foreigners who work in China must contribute. When you sign an employment contract, you must apply for a social insurance number, and it is important that your employer work with you to comply with the regulations. Please check the official website for updated information. Special Scrutiny of Foreign Citizens: On occasion in recent years, citizens of the United States and other countries visiting or resident in China have been interrogated or detained for reasons said to be related to “state security.” In such circumstances, you could face arrest, detention or an exit ban prohibiting your departure from China for a prolonged period. Dual U.S.-Chinese nationals and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be at a higher risk of facing such special scrutiny. Information about dual nationality can be found on our website. Foreigners working for NGOs in China have also recently faced additional scrutiny, and China will implement a new law regulating foreign NGO activity in January 2017. NGOs and their employees should ensure they are complying with all relevant statutory requirements, particularly if working in sensitive areas or fields.

Hotel rooms (including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, Internet usage, and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without your consent or knowledge. Security personnel have been known to detain and deport U.S. citizens sending private electronic messages critical of the Chinese government.

If you are a dual national of the United States and China, the Chinese government will usually not permit the U.S. Embassy to provide consular assistance to you unless you entered China on a U.S. passport with a valid Chinese visa. Regardless of your travel documents, if you are a dual national, or otherwise have ethnic or historical ties to China, it is possible that Chinese authorities will assert that you are a Chinese citizen and deny your access to U.S. consular representatives if you are detained. If you are a naturalized U.S. citizen or have a possible claim to Chinese citizenship, and you are traveling to China, you should ensure that you are well informed about Chinese law and practices relating to determination and loss of Chinese citizenship, including the possible need to formally renounce Chinese citizenship, cancel a household register (“hukou”), etc. Chinese authorities generally consider a child born in China to at least one Chinese parent to be a Chinese citizen, even if the child was issued a U.S. passport at the time of birth. If you have or had a claim to Chinese citizenship and your child is born in China, prior to departing China with your child, you should contact the local Public Security Bureau and/or Entry-Exit Bureau for information on obtaining a travel document.

Yellow reflective vests are required in all cars in case of a roadside emergency. Mandatory vehicular inspections are required yearly in order to renew your mandatory car insurance. In the more remote parts of Chile, gas stations and roadside assistance may be limited so it is advisable to travel with at least one spare tire and extra fuel.",

Some primary roads to remote tourist attractions are not paved, but are well maintained, with graded gravel. Many drivers do not signal lane changes and rarely yield to merging traffic. Many drivers exceed posted speed limits, do not maintain safe distances, and do not observe posted road signs. Major arteries in Santiago may switch directions during morning and evening rush hours. Drivers must carry sufficient Chilean pesos to pay frequent highway tolls.",

Renting a car is also possible although insurance may not be available in some forms for drivers without a Chilean or international driver’s license.

Public Transportation : Taxis and public transportation are generally safe, plentiful, and relatively inexpensive. Avoid using unmetered taxis; if you do use an unmetered taxi, agree to a fare before embarking. To use the public bus system in Santiago you need to obtain the prepaid “Bip” card. This card can also be used when traveling on the Santiago subway . See our Road Safety page for more information.

Medical care in Chile is generally good, though it may not meet U.S. standards in remote areas. Major hospitals accept credit cards, but many doctors and hospitals in Chile expect immediate payment in cash. Prescriptions written by local doctors and over-the-counter medicines are widely available. If you take any prescription medications make sure you bring enough to cover the duration of your stay in Chile. Chile imposes several restrictions on the importation of medical products and the Embassy cannot assist U.S. citizens to import medical supplies or medications. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance (our webpage) to cover medical evacuation.

You may not have the same protections available to you as under U.S. law, and penalties for breaking the law can also be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating Chile's laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Chile are strict, and convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and fines. Persons engaging in sexual conduct with children and using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country may be prosecuted in the United States. Please see our information on Criminal Penalties . If you are arrested and unable to hire legal representation, an attorney from the Public Defense Attorney’s Office (Defensoria Penal Publica) will be assigned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Special Circumstances: Chile lies in an active seismic zone and is prone to major earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. Several of the strongest earthquakes in history have occurred in Chile. Prepare yourself for a natural disaster by consulting the websites of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Chile's Oficina Nacional de Emergencia (ONEMI). If you are on the coast of Chile and there is a tsunami warning, it is imperative that you follow the tsunami evacuation signs and move to higher ground quickly. Recommendations for what to do during a tsunami warning can be found here . Minefields are found in Chile's northern border region with Peru and Bolivia and around the southern border with Argentina in Patagonia. Minefields are generally marked, but markers may have shifted or may not be visible. Follow clearly identified roads and trails when traveling in minefield areas. Border crossings should only be made at authorized locations. Consult with national park or other local officials concerning minefields and other hazards.",
      "Chile is a popular destination for outdoor and adventure sports. Despite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting persons lost or injured in isolated and wilderness areas is difficult. U.S. citizens engaging in outdoor activities along the border with Argentina, Bolivia or Peru are encouraged to register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs agency DIFROL (Dirección de Fronteras y Límites). A permit can be obtained from DIFROL that will allow U.S. citizens to cross borders temporarily in order to engage in these outdoor activities. Before you go, learn about local hazards and weather conditions. You can obtain information in Spanish about national parks and wilderness areas from the Chilean Forestry Service , mountain climbing from the Federacion de Andinismo de Chile , and weather forecasts from the Chilean Meteorological Service . Forest fires can be a problem in many areas of the country, including areas frequented by tourists. Historically many fires occur during the dry summer months of December, January, and February, sometimes burning hundreds of acres. Check the Chilean National Travel Board (Spanish only) or the Chilean Federal Emergency Agency websites for alerts. Inform park rangers, police, or other local authorities of your itinerary, and report missing or injured persons to the police immediately.",
      "Chile’s mountains and ski resorts are the recreational destination for thousands of skiers and snowboarders each year. The main ski centers in Chile have good safety standards with well groomed runs, ski and snowboard lessons with certified instructors, and clear signals for closure and opening of runs. Skiing and snowboarding, however, are inherently dangerous sports and injury or death is always a possibility. Skiers and snowboarders should respect the rules of each ski resort and be aware that skiing or boarding out of bounds is extremely dangerous. Outdoor sports and travel in Chile have a slightly higher degree of risk than in the United States. While the infrastructure and safety standards are generally good, the distances between some centers for outdoor sports and top-notch hospital care can be extreme, delaying treatment times. Additionally, Chile’s geography means a long medical evacuation to the highest level trauma centers in the country, located in Santiago. While clinics and hospitals in smaller cities can be superb in many respects and have saved the lives of several critical accident victims in recent years, some citizens may prefer post operative care in Santiago or the United States. Medical evacuation is expensive and can be difficult to arrange. We strongly suggest that all travelers, but especially “adventure” travelers, procure medical evacuation insurance prior to arrival.",
      "A recent decree signed by the Minister of Interior, based on a law for protection of national parks and monuments provides authority to regional governors to expel foreigners from Chile for damaging objects or places that are part of the national heritage. In 2015, two U.S. citizens were expelled from Torres del Paine National Park for igniting a fire in a small camp stove in a designated no fires area. Smoking a cigarette in these areas can also result in a large fine and expulsion from the park and from Chile. Travelers should make a point to learn all the rules of visiting national parks and observe them strictly. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:",

      "Strikes are common and can cause significant travel delays. These can be especially problematic if traveling to remote areas of Chile, such as Easter Island, Punta Arenas, and Chiloe, where transportation options are limited. The strikes generally last only a few days, but can bring all transportation to a standstill and strand passengers in remote locations. U.S. Citizens should be alert to the news and plan accordingly, including being prepared to adjust travel plans. The U.S. Embassy recommends that you contact your airline representative to get the latest information on travel delays related to strikes and work with the airline to reschedule your travel arrangements",

These attacks have mainly targeted forestry corporations and private Chilean landowners, rather than tourists or visitors. Nevertheless, U.S. citizens are advised to exercise caution when traveling in the Araucanía region.",

      "Crime:",
      "Most foreigners visit Chile without incident. The security environment is generally safe, and there is comparatively less violent crime in Chile than in other Latin American countries. Nevertheless, street crime, telephone scams, and residential break-ins are common, especially in Santiago, Valparaiso, Antofagasta, Calama, and Iquique. As in any large city, be cautious and aware of your surroundings. Be alert for pick-pocketing, purse and camera snatching, and thefts from backpacks and rental cars. Petty crime is common in major tourist destinations, in hotel lobbies and restaurants, near ATM machines/banks, internet cafes, at bus and subway stations, and in cruise ship ports. Exercise caution when touring Cerro Santa Lucia, Cerro San Cristobal, Mercado Central, Plaza de Armas, Bellavista, and Barrio Lastarria in Santiago as pick-pocketing and muggings occur frequently in these areas. Criminals usually work in groups and employ a variety of ruses to distract and victimize unsuspecting visitors. Those taking buses in Chile, especially to or from Calama, should keep all valuables, identification, and passport on themselves at all times – bags/purses placed beneath the bus, in the overhead compartments or beneath one’s feet are often reported stolen. Many times these thefts are done by someone appearing to be an employee of the bus company or terminal.",
      "Since 2014, there have been numerous reports of ATMs being filled with gas and blown up, often in the very late evening/very early morning hours, in order to steal money. In these cases, the motive is theft, not terrorism. A few taxi drivers engage in currency switching and overcharge with altered taxi meters. Incidents of individuals smashing car windows of occupied vehicles stopped in traffic and taking items of value on seats have occurred. Drivers should keep car doors locked at all times and valuables out of sight while driving and while the vehicle is parked. “Portonazo” crime - a form of carjacking in which the assailants target the arrival and departure of a vehicle at slow moving gates – does occur, especially in Santiago. These carjackings can occur at any location, to include in hotel garages, commercial malls, residences, apartment complexes, and commercial garages.",
      "Additionally, residential burglaries, including home invasions, and vehicle theft remain highly prevalent in the metropolitan Santiago area.

      "U.S. citizens entering Chile must have a passport in good condition, valid for the period of your stay. U.S. citizens traveling to Chile for recreation, tourism, business, or academic conferences do not need to obtain a visa prior to their arrival in Chile if traveling with a tourist passport. All official and diplomatic passport holders are required to obtain a visa prior to travel regardless of the purpose of their visit. For those traveling with a tourist passport, a Tourist Card or printed receipt will be issued to each visitor at immigration for a stay of up to 90 days. An extension of stay for another 90 days is possible upon payment of a USD 100 extension fee at the Chilean Immigration Office located at San Antonio 580, Santiago; telephone (56) 2 2550-2469. The Tourist Card must be surrendered upon departure. Failure to submit this card upon departure may result in delays until a replacement is obtained. If lost or stolen, the Tourist Card must be replaced by the International Police (website is in Spanish only) at their nearest headquarters or at the international airport prior to departure. Chile has very strict entry/exit requirements for minors (under the age of 18 years old), especially minors traveling with only one parent. Please review our section below on entry/exit requirements for minors prior to traveling to Chile to ensure full compliance with Chilean immigration law. Travelers who are not in compliance with Chilean entry/exit requirements may be denied permission to exit Chile. It is the traveler’s responsibility to comply with these requirements, and the U.S. Government is not able to intervene in these cases. If you have stayed in Chile for more than the allowed time period, you will not be allowed to leave the country without paying a fine. This fine cannot be paid at the airport or any border crossing, so you must pay it before attempting to depart Chile. To pay the fine prior to your departure, you should go to the Departamento de Extranjería and make an autodenuncia or complaint against yourself in the Sanciones (sanctions) office. Upon doing this, you will be told how much the fine will be, and, once you pay it, you can depart Chile. If you attempt to depart Chile without paying the fine, your passport will be confiscated by the airport police, and they will give you instructions on how to pay the fine. This process involves going to multiple Chilean government offices, first to find out how much the fine is, then to pay the fine, next to show that you have paid the fine, so that you can get a document indicating your passport should be returned, and lastly, to retrieve your passport. The entire process may take several days and could take up to three weeks. U.S. citizens who intend to work, live, or study in Chile must apply in advance for a Chilean visa. Your can enquire with the closest Chilean Consulate (see list here ) for further information.",
      "The Government of Chile requires U.S. government travelers on official business to enter the country with a diplomatic or official passport and a valid Chilean visa. Maximum visa validity is five years or up to the maximum validity of the passport, whichever is sooner. Visas must be obtained at a Chilean Embassy or Consulate before traveling to or through Chile. Official travelers attempting entry on tourist passports will be denied entry, detained, and returned to the point of origin at personal expense. U.S. Government officials should only use their tourist passports to enter Chile while here on personal tourism. The U.S. Embassy cannot secure entry on your behalf if you arrive without a valid U.S. passport, with a passport that is damaged or mutilated, or if you arrive without a visa when one is required. Entry / Exit Requirements for Dual Nationals: Dual U.S./Chilean nationals must enter and exit Chile using their Chilean passports, and they must enter and exit the United States using their U.S. passports. A naturalization certificate is not a valid travel document. The Government of Chile considers all persons born in Chile or born to a Chilean parent overseas to be citizens, even if they have since acquired U.S. citizenship. We have seen cases of U.S. citizen children, born in the United States to Chilean parents, who entered Chile on U.S. passports, being required by Chilean authorities to obtain Chilean passports in order to leave the country. This generally occurs when the child overstays the 90-day tourist entry period. Contact a Chilean Embassy or Consulate for more information. The U.S. Embassy cannot intervene if Chilean officials prevent a dual citizen from departing Chile due to lack of a Chilean passport.",
      "Entry / Exit Requirements for Minors: In an effort to prevent international child abduction, Chile has put in place strict requirements for the entry/exit of minors under the age of 18. Even when the minor is traveling with both parents, the parents will be required to show evidence of their relationship to the child when departing the country. Please carry an original birth certificate or a certified copy of the original.",
      "Minors who are resident in Chile will always be required to submit a written notarized authorization from any non-traveling parent(s) and a birth certificate at the time of departure. In Chile, the authorization can be executed before a local notary public. If the non-traveling parent(s) is in the United States, the written authorization can be notarized and executed directly at the Chilean Embassy or Consulate . If the non-traveling parent is in the United States and is unable to visit the Chilean Embassy or a Chilean Consulate, the authorization can be executed by a U.S. notary. However, an authorization executed by a U.S. notary must be authenticated to be valid in Chile. This means that after the document is notarized, it must be authenticated through a chain of steps involving submission to local, state, and national authorities before it can be submitted to the Chilean Embassy or Consulate. Click here to find additional information on the authentication process. Note that the final step in the process is to submit the document to the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chile to authenticate the signature of the Chilean official in the United States. This is a lengthy process and should be commenced well in advance of travel.",
      "A minor entering Chile as a tourist will generally not be required to present a written notarized authorization from the non-traveling parent(s) at the time of departure if the minor leaves with the same adult companion with whom the minor entered Chile. This does not apply to dual- citizen minors – a minor possessing Chilean citizenship is never considered to be a tourist in Chile even if the minor lives abroad. The minor’s immigration record will be annotated to record the name of the adult(s) with him or her at the time of entering the country. However, we recommend traveling with a written notarized authorization from the non-traveling parent in order to avoid misunderstandings and ensure a smooth exit out of the country. On occasion, a parent traveling with a minor child for tourism purposes has encountered difficulty exiting the country because the parent did not possess a notarized statement from the non-traveling parent. Minors departing alone or in the company of another party are required to submit a written notarized authorization from the non-traveling parent(s) and birth certificate. If the authorization is notarized outside of Chile, it must be authenticated following the steps in the paragraph above.",
      "The written notarized authorization should be in Spanish and include the following: 1) the full name of the custodial and/or non-custodial parents(s) or legal guardians; 2) the parents’ full address; 3) the full name of the child; 4) the child’s date of birth, place of birth, passport number and date of issuance; 5) full name and passport details of the person accompanying the minor; 6) dates of travel, including arrival and departure information; 7) address where the minor will reside; and 8) explicit authorization that a minor can travel alone or in the company of another person.",
      "The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist with requests for assistance in resolving entry and exit issues. This includes cases where a resident parent exercises custodial rights over their child(ren) but is unable to legally exit Chile and/or relocate to another country with the child because the child’s other parent does not authorize his/her departure. Judicial cases involving exit permissions and relocation cases are generally complex, lengthy, and expensive in Chile. The Chilean Supreme Court in a recent case interpreted a section of Chilean family law ( law number 16.618 , articles 49 and 49bis) governing exit permissions to mean that an exit permission may only be granted for a maximum period of 15 days. While other family judges have granted exit permissions for longer periods of time, U.S. citizens should be aware that there are major differences in how this law is interpreted and applied in exit permission cases. The U.S. Embassy encourages U.S. citizens to obtain legal counsel as soon as possible if dealing with custodial or relocation issues in Chile. The Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides information about requirements for children traveling into and out of Chile. The U.S. Embassy will note that decisions by Chilean immigration (PDI) at the Port of Entry sometimes differ from what is stated on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entry/exit requirements due to the discretion of the immigration officials. Visit the Embassy of Chile website for the most current visa information. The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Chile.

      "Road Conditions and Safety : Due to the security environment in Colombia, U.S. government officials and their families are not permitted to travel by road between most major cities. They also cannot use inter-city or intra-city bus transportation or travel by road outside urban areas at night. You are encouraged to follow these same precautions. Please refer to the Travel Warning for Colombia for details. Although some of Colombia’s roads and highways have greatly improved in recent years, road travel throughout Colombia can still be dangerous, especially at night. Some roads are poorly maintained, or vulnerable to heavy rains and mudslides. Mountain roads may lack safety features such as crash barriers or guard rails, and conditions are frequently made more treacherous by heavy fog. Highways are often unmarked and unlit, and do not have signs indicating destinations. In addition, slow-moving buses and trucks frequently stop in the middle of the road unexpectedly. In the countryside, livestock is often herded along roads or grazes on roadsides. Due to a lack of sidewalks, many roads are also used by pedestrians. The use of motorcycles is widespread in most major Colombian cities. According to the Colombian National Institute of Pathology and Forensic Science (Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses), 45% of traffic fatalities in 2014 involved motorcycles. There were 2,914 motorcycle accidents in 2014. U.S. government officials may not use on-road motorcycles because of security and crime issues. Traffic Laws : Traffic laws in Colombia, including speed limits, are often ignored and rarely enforced, creating dangerous conditions for drivers and pedestrians in major cities. Under Colombian law, seat belts are mandatory for front-seat passengers in a private vehicle. Car seats are mandatory for children, and a child under ten years old is not permitted to ride in a front seat. It is against the law to talk on a cellular phone while driving in Colombia, and violators may be fined. While driving outside major cities, you must drive with your lights on. If you are involved in an accident, you MUST remain at the scene without moving your vehicle until the authorities arrive. This rule is strictly enforced, and moving a vehicle or leaving the scene of an accident may constitute an admission of guilt under Colombian law. Public Transportation : U.S. government officials may not use public transportation because of security issues and crime. You should not hail a taxi on the street. Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the website of the Colombian agency for tourism promotion and the national authority responsible for road safety, the Instituto Nacional de Vias . Aviation Safety Oversight : The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Colombia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Colombia’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page ."

For more information, visit the website of Colombian Society for Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery . Travelers to Bogota may need time to adjust to the altitude of 8,600 feet. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Colombia to ensure the medication is legal Colombia.

Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Colombia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions, with significant expense and great hardship for themselves and their families. Colombian law requires that released offenders serve a lengthy period of parole in country, during which the offender is given no housing and may lack permission to work. Family members must often support the offender until the parole period expires. Colombia employs strict screening procedures for detecting narcotics smuggling at its international airports. Travelers are occasionally questioned, searched, fingerprinted, and/or asked to submit to an abdominal X-ray upon arrival or departure. Most airport inspectors do not speak English, and travelers who do not speak Spanish may have difficulty understanding what is asked of them. Customs Regulations : Travelers generally must not enter or exit Colombia while carrying cash or other financial instruments worth more than 10,000 USD. If you do, you must declare it and be able to prove the legal source of the financial instruments. Colombian law prohibits tourists and business travelers from bringing firearms and ammunition into Colombia. Colombian law also restricts the importation of plants and animals (or products made from either). Donations of Goods: Visit the web site for Colombian Customs detailing charitable import regulations. Artifacts : Colombian law forbids the export of pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts protected by cultural patrimony statutes. U.S. customs officials are obliged to seize pre-Columbian objects and certain colonial religious artwork brought into the United States.

See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance : Access to buildings, sidewalks and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with disabilities. Most hospitals in major cities are wheelchair accessible. Sidewalks (if they exist) are uneven and rarely have ramps at intersections. Pedestrian crossings are infrequent and motorists almost never give pedestrians the right of way. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations for disabled persons.

      "Please read the current Travel Warning for Colombia . Demonstrations: Demonstrations and protests occur frequently in Colombia, particularly in Bogota. You should avoid areas of demonstrations as they can become violent. Crime: Robbery and other violent crimes, as well as scams against unsuspecting tourists, are common in urban areas. Firearms are prevalent in Colombia; muggings or robberies can quickly turn violent. The Embassy continues to receive reports of violent and petty crime, including pickpocketing of passports in the El Dorado Airport in Bogota.. ATMs: People are sometimes robbed after using automatic teller machines (ATMs) on the street. Use ATMs inside shopping malls or other protected locations. Taxis: U.S. government personnel are prohibited from hailing taxis on the street due to the risk of assault or robbery. U.S. citizens have been killed during robberies while using taxis, most recently in September 2015 in Medellin. Typically, the driver—who may be one of the conspirators—will stop to pick up armed cohorts, who enter the cab, overpower and rob the passenger, as well as force the victim to make multiple ATM withdrawals. Use telephone or internet-based dispatch service applications whenever possible. Many hotels, restaurants, and stores will call a taxi for you. When a taxi is dispatched, the dispatcher creates a record of the call and the responding taxi.Authorized taxi booths are present in most airports in Colombia. Disabling Drugs : Criminals in Colombia may use disabling drugs such as scopolamine to temporarily incapacitate unsuspecting victims and then rob or assault them. Avoid leaving food or drinks unattended at a bar or restaurant, and be suspicious if a stranger offers you something to eat or drink. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 123 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +57 (1) 275-4021.

      "Road Conditions and Safety: Costa Rican road conditions can significantly differ from those in the United States. Traffic is heavy in the San Jose metropolitan area and traffic jams should be expected. Roads are often in poor condition and large potholes with the potential to cause significant damage to vehicles are commonplace.",
      "Signage can be inadequate and few roads have clearly marked lanes. Shoulders are narrow or consist of drainage ditches. Visibility at intersections is often limited by hedges or other obstacles. Bridges, even on heavily traveled roads, may be only a single lane, requiring drivers to cede the right of way to oncoming vehicles.",
      "The fatality rate for pedestrians and those riding bicycles and motorcycles is disproportionately high and farm animals are common sights along or on main roads. Buses and cars frequently stop in travel lanes, even on expressways. Motorcyclists often drive without respect to rules of the road, passing on the right, or weaving in and out without warning.",
      "Main highways and principal roads in the major cities are paved, but some roads to beaches and other rural locations are not. Many destinations are accessible only with four-wheel drive vehicles with high ground clearance. When staying outside of urban areas, travelers should call ahead to their hotels to ask about the current status of access roads. Landslides are common in the rainy season.",
      "Rural roads sometimes lack bridges, compelling motorists to ford waterways. Exercise extreme caution in driving across moving water, as even a few inches of moving water may be sufficient to float your vehicle and the riverbed may not be stable.",
      "Travelers should also minimize driving at night, especially outside of urban areas.",
      "Traffic Laws: Drivers need to show a valid U.S. driver’s license or an international driving permit. Fines for routine traffic violations can be upwards of $500 USD.",
      "Laws and speed limits are often ignored, turn signals are rarely used, passing on dangerous stretches of highway is common, and pedestrians are not given the right of way.",
      "In the event of a traffic accident, vehicles should not be moved from where the accident occurred. Both the traffic police and an insurance investigator must make accident reports before the vehicles can be moved.",
      "In the case of a traffic fatality, a judge must arrive at the scene to pronounce a person dead, which could take several hours. Visitors contemplating driving in Costa Rica should carefully consider the implications of not being allowed to depart the country for many months or longer in the event of an investigation into a vehicular accident resulting in injuries or death.",
      "U.S. citizens have occasionally reported to the Embassy that charges for unpaid traffic tickets have appeared on the credit card that was on file with the rental car company. The Embassy cannot intervene in such cases.",
      "Aviation Safety Oversight: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Costa Rica’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Costa Rica’s air carrier operations Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page ."

      "Most prescription and over-the-counter medications are available throughout Costa Rica; however, some U.S. citizens travel regularly to the United States to fill prescriptions that are unavailable in Costa Rica. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.",
      "The U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply overseas.",

Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services. U.S. Embassy San Jose maintains a list of local doctors and medical facilities here .",

      "Vaccinations: Proof of yellow fever vaccination must be presented upon arrival for all passengers coming from certain countries in South America or Africa. Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Medical Tourism: Medical tourists should confirm that facilities and professionals are accredited, have an acceptable level of care, that their insurance will cover any associated costs, and that the cost and payment for treatment is clearly understood. Individuals considering visits to clinics offering alternative medicine cures for diseases or addictions should research these clinics and their providers thoroughly. Persons with unpaid or disputed debts in Costa Rica may be legally prevented from leaving the country.",
      "In the event of unforeseen medical complications or malpractice, medical tourists may not be covered by their personal insurance, and malpractice lawsuits are less likely to be successful than in the United States. Although many hospitals and clinics have medical malpractice insurance, seeking compensation can prove to be difficult because insurance laws and legal options may not exist.",
      "Should you need or wish to be transferred to a hospital in the United States and do not have medical evacuation insurance, an air ambulance flight can cost upwards of $20,000 to $40,000 USD and will often take place only after it has been paid for.",

      "Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.",
      "Arrest Notification: If you are arrested in Costa Rica, authorities are required to notify the U.S. Embassy of your arrest. If you are concerned that the Department of State may not be aware of your situation, you should request the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy of your arrest. The law permits pre-trial detention of persons accused of serious crimes.",
      "Judicial Process: Due to case backlogs, judicial processes can take years to complete and civil suits on average can take over five years to resolve. Some U.S. firms and citizens have satisfactorily resolved their cases through the courts, while others have seen proceedings drawn out over a decade without a final ruling.",

      "Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While in Costa Rica, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation limited. Costa Rica mandates access to transportation, communication and public buildings for persons with disabilities, but laws may not be effectively enforced. Many buildings remain inaccessible and the Costa Rican Ombudsman’s Office has received several noncompliance reports regarding accessibility or malfunctioning of hydraulic wheelchair lifts for public transportation.",
      "Students: For periods of study under 90 days with a round-trip ticket, no visa is required. Most Costa Rican educational institutions assist individuals planning to study longer than three months to obtain a student visa. You should verify requirements with your nearest Costa Rican embassy or consulate and with your airline.",
      "Real Estate: U.S. citizens are urged to use extreme caution when making real estate purchases or investments, to consult with reputable legal counsel, and to investigate thoroughly all aspects before entering into a contract. There is very little that the U.S. Embassy can do to assist U.S. citizens who enter into land or business disputes in Costa Rica; you must be prepared to take your case to the local courts.",
      "Please note civil archives recording land titles are at times incomplete or contradictory.",
      "Coastal land within 50 meters of the high tide line is open to the public and therefore closed to development, and the next 150 meters inland generally are administered as Maritime Zones by the local municipality. Expropriation of private land by the government without compensation considered adequate or prompt has hurt some U.S. investors.",
      "Property owners are encouraged to maintain security and access controls on any private property. Organized squatter groups have invaded properties in various parts of the country, taking advantage of legal provisions that allow people without land to gain title to unused property.

Street signage tends to be insufficient and confusing. Many Cuban cars are old, in poor condition, and lack turn signals, reliable brakes, and other standard safety equipment.",
      "The principal Cuban east-west highway is in good condition but lacks lighting and extends only part of the way from Havana to the eastern tip of the island. Road signage on highways may be lacking or confusing. Night driving should be strictly avoided outside urban areas. Lack of emergency lights or signals makes it virtually impossible to detect hazards at night. There have been multiple recent fatalities and serious injuries to U.S. citizens who have collided with broken down vehicles or trucks with no headlights on Cuban highways at night. Secondary rural roads are narrow, and some are in such bad condition as to be impassable by cars. Due to the rarity of cars on rural roads, pedestrians, bicycles, horse-drawn carts, and farm equipment operators wander onto the roads without any regard to possible automobile traffic. Unfenced livestock constitute another serious road hazard.",
      "Rental car agencies provide roadside assistance to their clients as a condition of the rental contract. Automobile renters are provided telephone numbers to call in case of emergency; agencies generally respond as needed with tow trucks and/or mechanics. A similar service is available to foreign residents of Cuba who insure cars with the National Insurance Company.",
      "Anecdotal reports indicate the maintenance that rental car agencies provide to their fleets is inadequate and may cause an accident. Cuban authorities may prohibit drivers of rental cars who are involved in accidents from leaving the country, even if they are injured and require medical attention, until all claims associated with an accident are settled.",

Many medications are unavailable, so travelers to Cuba should bring with them any prescribed medicine in its original container and in amounts commensurate with personal use. Travelers may also wish to consider bringing small additional amounts of prescribed medicines and over-the-counter remedies in the event that a return to the United States is delayed for unforeseen reasons. A copy of the prescription and a letter from the prescribing physician explaining the need for prescription drugs may facilitate their entry into the country.",

Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through scrupulous washing of hands and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating. The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk (see the CDC Food &amp; Water Safety website ). Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting out on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them. Drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice because it may have been made from unclean water.",
      "Dengue: Dengue is mosquito-borne illnesses that is becoming more frequent in tropical and equatorial climates around the world. Symptoms can include fever, rash, severe headache, joint pain, and muscle or bone pain. There are no specific treatments for Dengue and vaccines are still in the developmental phase. Preventing mosquito bites is the most important way to prevent these illnesses. Avoidance and prevention techniques include: reducing mosquito exposure by using repellents, covering exposed skin, treating clothing and tents with permethrin and sleeping in screened or air conditioned rooms. You can also reduce exposure through mosquito control measures, including emptying water from outdoor containers and spraying to reduce mosquito populations. The Aedes mosquitos that carry this illness are primarily day biting and often live in homes and hotel rooms especially under beds, in bathrooms and closets. Travelers should carry and use CDC recommended insect repellents containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535, which will help diminish bites from mosquitoes as well as ticks, fleas, chiggers, etc., some of which may also carry infectious diseases.

Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating Cuba’s laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Cuba are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Those accused of drug-related and other crimes face long legal proceedings and delayed due process. In some cases, the Cuban government has not permitted U.S. consular access to Cuban-American prisoners.",

U.S. citizen drivers involved in traffic accidents that result in the death or injury of any party may be held criminally liable, regardless of fault. The U.S. Embassy recommends extreme caution when driving in Cuba as hazardous road conditions, poor signage, and jaywalking pedestrians may result in accidents. See TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS for more information.",

Entering Cuba with a firearm or even a single round of ammunition is illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into Cuba unintentionally. The Cuban government strictly enforces laws restricting the entry of firearms and ammunition at airports and seaports, and routinely x-rays all incoming luggage. U.S. citizens entering Cuba with a weapon or any quantity of ammunition, even accidentally, are subject to fines or possible imprisonment. We strongly advise travelers to thoroughly inspect all belongings prior to travel to Cuba to avoid the accidental import of ammunition or firearms.",

For example, you can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Bringing counterfeit and pirated goods into the United States may be illegal, and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",

The Cuban government requires U.S.-Cuban dual citizens (see the State Department’s page on dual nationals) who departed Cuba on or after January 1, 1971 to enter and depart Cuba using a Cuban passport. Using a Cuban passport for this purpose does not jeopardize one's U.S. citizenship; however, such persons must use their U.S. passports to enter and depart the United States. Cuban-Americans who departed Cuba before January 1, 1971 may travel to Cuba on their U.S. passport but must apply for an HE-11 visa from the Cuban Embassy.

As such, Cuban authorities do not always notify the U.S. Embassy of the arrest of dual nationals and may deny U.S. consular officers access to them. They may also withhold from U.S. authorities information concerning the welfare and treatment of dual nationals.",

Historically, U.S.-issued debit and credit cards were not accepted in Cuba, however travelers should check with their financial institution before traveling to determine whether the institution has established the necessary mechanisms for its issued debit and credit cards to be used to Cuba. The Cuban government requires the use of convertible Cuban pesos or non-convertible Cuban pesos (“moneda nacional”) for all transactions. The official exchange rate for convertible Cuban pesos (CUC) is 1 USD = 1 CUC; however, a minimum 10 percent fee for exchanging U.S. dollars and other transaction fees make the effective exchange rate at hotels, airports, and currency exchange houses lower. The current exchange rate for CUC to non-convertible Cuban pesos (CUP) is 1 CUC = 24 CUP.

If U.S. travelers return from Cuba with unauthorized goods of Cuban origin, such goods, with the exception of informational materials, may be seized at U.S. Customs’ discretion (see 31 CFR section 515.204). Cuban cigars and rum are routinely confiscated at U.S. ports of entry. Purchasing Cuban cigars and rum in a &quot;duty-free&quot; shop at the Havana Airport does not exempt them from the 100 USD limitation for personal use, and if not compliant with the regulation, seizure by U.S. Customs. There are no limits on the import or export of informational materials as set forth in 31 C.F.R. section 515.206. Blank tapes and CDs are not considered informational materials and may be seized. To be considered informational material, artwork must be classified under Chapter subheading 9701, 9702, or 9703 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (for example, original paintings, drawings, pastels, engravings, prints, and sculptures are exempt from import and export restrictions).",

      "Cuban territorial waters are extremely dangerous and difficult to navigate, even for experienced mariners. The potential for running aground is very high. Search-and-rescue capability in Cuba is limited and running aground will often lead to the complete destruction and loss of the vessel. U.S. boaters who enter Cuban waters have encountered problems that required repairs and/or salvage; costs for both are significantly higher than comparable services in the United States or elsewhere in the Caribbean. Cuban authorities typically hold boats as collateral payment. U.S.-registered or flagged vessels belonging to U.S. citizens have been permanently seized by Cuban authorities. Repairs take significantly longer in Cuba than they would in the United States due to lack of the most basic materials and to bureaucratic impediments. Boaters are often confined to their boats while repairs are made. Boaters can be detained while Cuban authorities investigate the circumstances of their entry to Cuba, especially if their travel documents are not in order or if they are suspected of illegal activities. Mariners and their passengers should not navigate close to Cuban territorial waters unless seeking a safe port due to emergencies. The ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist mariners in distress is limited due to Cuban restrictions on travel by U.S. personnel outside of Havana.

There is anecdotal evidence that violent crime has increased in Cuba and is generally associated with assaults committed during a burglary or robbery. The U.S. government cannot confirm this information but rates the threat of crime in Cuba as medium. In the event of a confrontation, travelers should not resist, as perpetrators may be armed.

      "Cuba is an authoritarian state that routinely employs repressive methods against internal dissent and monitors and responds to perceived threats to authority. These methods may include physical and electronic surveillance, as well as detention and interrogation of both Cuban citizens and foreign visitors. Human rights conditions in Cuba remain poor, as the Cuban government limits fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. U.S. citizens visiting Cuba should be aware that any on-island activities may be subject to surveillance, and their contact with Cuban citizens monitored closely. Cuba generally welcomes U.S. citizen travelers. In the past, U.S. credit or debit cards, personal checks, and travelers’ checks could not be used in Cuba. Currently, travelers are advised to check with their financial institution before traveling to determine whether the institution has established the necessary mechanisms for its issued credit and debit cards to be used in Cuba. The United States government provides consular and other services through the U.S. Embassy in Havana that is staffed by U.S. diplomats and locally-employed Cuban nationals in addition to eligible family members and third country nationals, but most U.S. diplomats are not allowed to travel freely outside the capital and may be prevented from providing assistance outside Havana.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Cabo Verde, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States.",
      "Cabo Verde has an extensive road system. On the islands of Santiago, Sal, and São Vicente, many urban and rural roads are asphalt. On the other islands (Fogo, Brava, Maio, São Nicolau, and Boa Vista), some roads are narrow, winding, and mostly cobblestone. During the rainy season, cobblestone roads are especially slippery, and mud and rockslides are common on roads that cut through mountains.",
      "Houses are often located adjacent to roadways, and drivers must be on the lookout for pedestrians, especially children, as well as herds of livestock. Roads and streets often are unlit, so driving at night is hazardous. Most accidents result from aggressive driving, excessive speed, passing in blind curves, and/or on inclines or declines in the rain. Driving while under the influence of alcohol is a problem in Cabo Verde. The peak times for drunk drivers are on Sundays and at night. Exercise extreme caution toward both pedestrians and other drivers after celebrations, festivals, and open-air concerts as well as during holiday periods, such as Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and Carnival.",
      "Full-service gas stations (no self-service) are available. Taxis and buses generally offer clean, dependable service on all islands. Bus service in Praia is inexpensive, and most buses are fairly new. Intra-island service usually consists of minivans (typically a Toyota Hiace) or converted pickup trucks that have benches along the edges of the pickup bed. Intra-island service can be dangerous because some drivers overload their vehicles, exceed the speed limit, or drive after drinking alcohol. Before entering any vehicle, riders should pay close attention to the appearance and behavior of the driver.",
      "In Cabo Verde, traffic moves on the right side of the road, as in the United States. At intersections, the vehicle on the right has the right-of-way, but at roundabouts (traffic circles), cars inside the circle have the right-of-way. Under Cabo Verdean law, seat belts must be worn at all times by the driver as well as the person in the front passenger seat. Children under 12 must sit in the back seat. Motorcyclists must wear crash helmets and use headlights at all times. Bicycling is common in Praia and in some other areas. The use of helmets, gloves, and /or other protective gear while bicycling is more widespread than in mainland African countries but not governed by local laws/regulations and not at all universal. Pedestrian striped crosswalks are common in Praia, Mindelo, and other large cities/towns, and are widely used and heeded by motorists.",

      "Medical facilities in Cabo Verde are limited, and, despite an extensive network of local pharmacies, some medications are in short supply or otherwise unavailable. The country’s largest hospitals (all public) are in Praia and Mindelo, but smaller public health centers and private medical clinics, of variable quality in both personnel and equipment, are located throughout the country. The islands of Brava and Santo Antão do not have airports, so air evacuation from them in the event of a medical emergency is impossible. Travelers are strongly encouraged to obtain travel health and medical evacuation insurance as medical situations experienced in-country can easily challenge the resources available locally, and emergency evacuations are expensive.",
      "Malaria exists in Cabo Verde but is mainly limited to the island of Santiago. Nationwide, malaria is far less prevalent than in mainland African countries with approximately 20-40 cases occurring annually, almost always among recent West African migrants who contracted the illness before arriving in the islands. Although many expatriates do not believe there is a need for malaria prophylaxis, it is important to be aware that there is an elevated risk of contracting the disease from July to December, especially during the rainy season (August-October).",
      "Zika Virus: Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact. The CDC has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects in some fetuses and babies born to infected mothers. For additional information about Zika, including travel advisories, visit the CDC website .",

      "Travelers should carry and use CDC recommended insect repellents containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 to help diminish bites from mosquitoes as well ticks, fleas, and chiggers, some of which may also carry infectious diseases and are advised to minimize exposure to both dengue and malaria by taking precautions against mosquito bites, which are most common at dawn and dusk, particularly from July to December. Like malaria, no vaccine exists for dengue, so travelers in Cabo Verde who exhibit symptoms as described on the CDC’s dengue fact sheet should immediately seek medical attention. Depending on how long you are in Cabo Verde, symptoms may not present themselves until after you return to the United States. Since medical professionals in the United States often do not test patients for either illness, make sure you tell the doctor evaluating your symptoms that you have recently been in a country where both malaria and dengue fever exist.",
      "Diarrheal illness is very common among travelers even in luxury accommodations. Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through careful hand washing and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating. The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk (see Food &amp; Water Safety ). Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them.",

Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could land you immediately in jail. These criminal penalties will vary from country to country. There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States, and you can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you engage in these activities. Buying pirated goods, engaging in sexual conduct with children and using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country are crimes prosecutable in the United States . If you break local laws in Cabo Verde, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It is very important to know what is legal and what is not wherever you go.",
      "While you are traveling in Cabo Verde, you are subject to its laws. People that violate Cabo Verdean laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Cabo Verde are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.",
      "Arrest notifications in host country: While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested in that country, others may not. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Inter-island travel is generally via ferry or 45-seat propeller planes. The islands of Brava and Santo Antão, however, are only accessible by boat. Not all flights between islands are direct, even if originally scheduled as such, and airline services may be delayed, re-routed, or cancelled due to poor visibility from dust or rain and related safety concerns. During peak travel seasons (summer and winter holidays), air travelers arriving from abroad into Praia and other major airports for connecting flights to other islands may experience luggage delays at their final destination because of the limited carrying capacity of aircraft. You should carry a change of clothing and all vital materials (including medications) in your carry-on luggage to tide you over for the first 24-48 hours in country. There is regular daily inter-island ferry service between Santo Antão and São Vicente. Ferry services are also available between Santiago, Brava, and Fogo but do not operate daily and the service schedules frequently change. Those planning to travel by ferry should plan well in advance and confirm a couple of days before departure that the ferry service is still operating. Regardless of whether your inter-island travel is by air or sea, be aware that poor weather and sea conditions often cause last-minute delays or cancellations.",
      "Only major cities and towns have Internet cafes, and international telecommunications services in Cabo Verde are dependent on trans-atlantic fiber-optic cables. Visitors who need reliable communication to other countries should consider carrying satellite-based voice and/or data equipment.",

However, there were no reported cases of official or private discrimination against LGBT individuals in employment, occupation, housing, statelessness, or access to education or health care, and there were no reported incidents of violence against LGBT persons in 2014-2015. There are no legal or governmental impediments to the organization of LGBT events. Arco-Iris Cabo Verde organized and celebrated the third annual week for the equality of LGBT people called “Mindelo Pride” in the city of Mindelo, Sao Vicente, in June 2015.",

      "ACCESSIBILITY: While in Cabo Verde, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States. The country’s rugged terrain, the widespread use of cobblestone streets and pathways, the very limited number of elevators in buildings, and the frequency of power outages all constitute significant hardships for persons with limited mobility. Although the Cabo Verdean constitution guarantees that persons with disabilities will receive priority in the provision of government services and stipulates that public buildings must be accessible to the disabled, in reality few such accommodations have been made."

      "Visitors traveling to Cabo Verde who wish to participate in water sports, swimming, boating, and fishing should exercise extreme caution since the tides and currents around the islands are very strong. Several small fishing boats have been lost at sea in recent years, an inter-island ferry sank in 2009, and drownings occur each year on the beaches in Praia. Most recently a ferry traveling between Praia and the island of Fogo with 26 passengers on-board sank in January of 2015.",
      "Cabo Verde, similar to Hawaii, is an archipelago of volcanic islands. Although volcanoes on most of the islands are now inactive, seismologists still consider the entire island of Fogo to be an active volcano; its last eruption occurred in November of 2014. Future eruptions remain a threat, as do earth tremors throughout the islands, especially on Fogo, Brava, and Santo Antão, and beneath the ocean channels that separate them. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency.",

      "CRIME: Petty crime and burglary are common in Cabo Verde, especially at marketplaces, festivals, street fairs, and public gatherings. Criminals do not necessarily target U.S. citizens, but rather anyone perceived to be affluent, regardless of nationality. Often, the perpetrators of petty theft and pickpocketing are gangs of street children, so visitors should avoid groups of children who appear to have no adult supervision. Muggings occur often, particularly at night and in more isolated areas, and increasingly involve violence. The perpetrators are predominantly males between the ages of 14 and 25 operating in groups of two or more to attack their victims. Due to inadequate lighting in many public areas, often caused by rolling power cuts in urban neighborhoods, you should be especially vigilant after dark, carry a small flashlight to illuminate your path, never go out alone, keep vehicle doors and windows locked, and avoid isolated places.",
      "The Embassy emphasizes the particular dangers of using hillside stairways connecting neighborhoods in Praia and many other Cabo Verdean cities and towns. These stairways, although offering convenient shortcuts through hilly terrain, make users vulnerable to assault, even in broad daylight with many people present. The Embassy strongly advises against using them at any time of day.",

      "The Republic of Cabo Verde is a developing country which consists of nine inhabited volcanic islands and several uninhabited islets off the western coast of Africa. Most islands (Santiago, São Vicente, Santo Antão, São Nicolau, Fogo, and Brava) are rugged and mountainous; three (Sal, Maio, and Boa Vista) are flat, desert islands with vast white sand beaches. Cabo Verde enjoys a stable, democratic parliamentary government. Praia, the capital and largest city (with a population of 140,000), is on the island of Santiago. Cabo Verde’s major shipping port and second-largest city, Mindelo (population 75,000), is on the island of São Vicente. Two languages are spoken widely in Cabo Verde: Portuguese (the official language, spoken by many but not all Cabo Verdeans) and Cabo Verdean Crioulo (a mixture of Portuguese and African languages). While the tourist industry brings an ever-growing number of visitors, tourist facilities on most of the islands remain limited. Sal and Boa Vista islands, however, each have a well-developed tourism infrastructure and extensive nonstop charter flight connections to various European airports. See “ SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ” below regarding issues which impact inter-island transport.",

      "Passports and visa : U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport to enter Dominica. No visa is required for stays less than 6 months if you have an onward or return ticket, confirmation of accommodation, and can produce evidence of your ability to maintain yourself. There is a departure tax of US $22 assessed when leaving Dominica. Children under twelve years of age are exempt from the departure tax. NOTE: Be aware that Caribbean cruises that begin and end in the United States (closed loop cruises) do not require that you travel with a valid passport. However, should you need to disembark due to an emergency and you do not have a valid passport, you may encounter difficulties entering or remaining in a foreign country. You may also have difficulty attempting to re-enter the United States by air because many airlines will require a valid passport before allowing you to board the aircraft. As such, we strongly recommend that you always travel abroad with your valid passport. HIV/AIDS : Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions may exist.

If you do elect to drive, you should be aware that defensive driving is necessary and extreme caution advised . Be especially vigilant when driving at night as drivers do not always use their lights and when driving in rural areas or along the border as animals are often encountered in the roadways.",
      "Visitors to the Dominican Republic should consider hiring a professional driver during their stay in lieu of driving themselves. Licensed drivers who are familiar with local roads can be hired through local car rental agencies. In case of accidents, only the driver will be taken into custody.",
      "Traffic Laws: Traffic laws exist however there is not consistent enforcement and they are not technically equivalent to those of the United States.",
      "Dominican law requires that a driver be taken into custody for being involved in an accident that causes serious injury or death, even if the driver is insured and appears not to have been at fault. The minimum detention period is 48 hours; however, detentions frequently last until a judicial decision is reached, or until a waiver is signed by the injured party.",

Penalties for drunk driving can include fines and/or imprisonment and the sentence is dependent upon whether or not injuries or damages were incurred as a result of drunk driving. Please refer to our information on Road Safety .",

The public buses and guaguas operating in the capital are not considered reliable or safe. Many unregulated taxis operating throughout the country lack basic safety features and should be avoided. We recommend that you only use a reputable, legitimate taxi service as recommended through your hotel or as part of a well-known, vetted vehicle service company.

U.S. citizens who have previously registered with the U.S. Embassy do not need to register again. Additional information on natural disasters and disaster preparedness can be found on our website. Real Estate: Real estate investments require a high level of caution, as property rights are irregularly enforced and investors often encounter problems in receiving clear title to land. We recommend consultation with a reputable attorney before signing documents or closing on any real estate transactions. Real estate investments by U.S. citizens have been the subject of both legal and physical takeover attempts. Absentee landlords and absentee owners of undeveloped land are particularly vulnerable. Investors should seek solid property title and not just a “ carta de constancia ,” which is often confused with a title. An official land registry measurement (also known as “ deslinde” or “mensura catastral” ) is also desirable for the cautious overseas investor. Investors should also consider purchasing title insurance. Scams: Be alert to a scam which targets elderly citizens. The perpetrator contacts a grandparent on the telephone pretending to be a law enforcement official, an attorney, or a U.S. Embassy official and informs them that a loved one has been arrested overseas. The caller instructs the victim to wire cash. In some instances, impersonators portray the role of the scared grandchild. When in doubt, please attempt to contact your loved one directly."

In November 2014, a leading Egyptian terrorist organization pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, increasing the risk that terrorist attacks could target U.S. and Western interests, including civilians, and the country’s tourist industry. In June, 2015, terrorists attempted to attack the Karnak temple in Luxor, but were successfully engaged by the police before entering the temple complex.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS : While in Equatorial Guinea, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. U.S. citizens on short stays are permitted to drive with an International Driver’s License. Generally, Equatorial Guinea's road networks are increasingly well-developed. Speed limits are posted in kilometers but rarely observed, and travelers should remain alert for pedestrians and livestock, even on multi-lane highways. Traffic signals and crosswalks are increasingly common, but not always heeded by local drivers. Driving while intoxicated is widespread, particularly at night and during weekends and holidays. Travelers should take additional care when driving at night as many motorists do not use headlights and roads are inconsistently lit. If you plan on driving around the country for any length of time, you should purchase a cell phone for use in an emergency.",
      "Equatoguinean cities have no reliable form of public transportation. Taxis, while inexpensive and readily available, are often poorly maintained, and taxi drivers frequently drive dangerously or while impaired. Travelers should be aware that taxis will stop to pick up additional passengers and may detour or drop passengers off out of sequence. Single travelers, particularly women, are advised to avoid taxis if possible, or to use taxi drivers personally known to them or recommended as being safe and reliable.",
      "Travelers outside the limits of Malabo and Bata will encounter military roadblocks, and police checks are increasingly common in both cities. You should be prepared to show proper identification (for example, a copy of your U.S. passport) and to explain your reason for being at that particular location. The personnel staffing these checkpoints are often poorly trained and do not speak English or French; travelers who do not speak Spanish should have their reason for being in the country and their itinerary written down in Spanish, especially if planning to travel into the countryside. Travelers should be aware that many military facilities are poorly marked and inconsistently staffed, especially in isolated areas. Travelers should try to avoid these sites whenever possible.",
      "There are currently no distracted driving laws in effect in the Equatorial Guinea, but police may pull over drivers who talk or text while driving for not following unspecific safe driving procedures.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information.",
      "AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Equatorial Guinea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Equatorial Guinea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page ."
    ],
    "health": [
      "Medical facilities are limited, though improving. Pharmacies in Malabo and Bata stock basic medicines including antibiotics, and do not carry U.S. brand names or generic over the counter (OTC) medications. Outside of these cities, many medicines are unavailable. You are advised to carry a supply of properly-labeled prescription drugs and other OTC medications adequate to cover your entire stay. Sanitation levels in hospitals are very low, except for La Paz Malabo Medical Center, a western level and acute care hospital and, to a lesser extent, in Bata, which meet many of the medical standards of a modern hospital in a developed country. Doctors and hospitals often require immediate payment for health services in cash (CFA), and do not accept dollars, credit cards, or any type of health insurance card. Patients are sometimes expected to supply their own bandages, linen, and toiletries. Emergency medical services (ambulances, trained paramedics) are only sporadically available and should not be relied upon in the event of an emergency.",
      "Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal mosquito-borne disease that is very common in most of the country; all travelers are recommended to take antimalarial prophylaxis. Despite aggressive attempts to control malaria in Malabo, the city is still a high risk area for malaria. Plasmodium falciparum, the predominant malaria strain in Equatorial Guinea, is resistant to the anti-malarial drug chloroquine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise that you take one of the following anti-malarial drugs: mefloquine, doxycycline, or atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone™). If you become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling in a malaria-risk area, and for up to one year after returning home, you should seek prompt medical attention and tell your physician your travel history and what antimalarial medication you have been taking.",
      "Visit the CDC's Travelers' Health page for additional information on malaria, including protective measures.",
      "There is a high risk of diarrheal disease throughout the country. Taking precautions when consuming food or beverages is essential to reduce the likelihood of illness. Travelers should carry loperamide and/or a quinolone antibiotic for presumptive self-treatment of diarrhea if it occurs.",
      "Yellow fever can cause serious medical problems, but the vaccine, required for entry, is very effective in preventing the disease. Yellow Fever vaccination is recommended for all those over nine months of age.",
      "In addition to malaria, many insect-borne illnesses such as dengue fever are present. To help prevent mosquito bites and illness, wear long sleeves and use topical repellants and bednets.",
      "No cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have been reported in Equatorial Guinea. Please read our Fact Sheet on Ebola or visit the CDC’s Information Page on Ebola for further information.",
      "Polio is an increasingly serious health concern in Equatorial Guinea. You can find further information about polio and recommended precautions for those traveling to Equatorial Guinea on the CDC website .",
      "All routine U.S. immunizations should also be up to date prior to arrival in Equatorial Guinea. This includes measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, Hepatitis A and tetanus, all of which are more common in Equatorial Guinea than in the United States. In addition to the required yellow fever vaccine and polio booster (if necessary), it is also recommended that all travelers receive typhoid immunization, but it is not required for entry.",
      "Rabies immunization is recommended for all travelers staying for more than four weeks or who will have remote, rural travel or expect animal exposure. Even in urban areas, dogs may have rabies and bites and scratches from dogs, bats or other mammals should be immediately cleaned with soap and water and medical evaluation sought to determine if additional rabies immunization is warranted.",
      "Equatorial Guinea is in the highest risk category for tuberculosis with over 100 cases per 100,000 population. Travelers planning to stay more than one month should have pre-departure tuberculin skin test status documented. Domestic help should be screened for TB.",
      "Schistosomiasis , a parasite transmitted by waterborne larvae that penetrate intact skin, presents significant risk on the mainland including Bata, but not on Bioko island. Travelers should avoid non-treated, freshwater exposure on the mainland.",
      "You can find detailed information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the CDC website .

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Equatorial Guinea, you are subject to its laws. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own. If you break local laws in Equatorial Guinea, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not wherever you go.",
      "There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",
      "In the recent past, a special permit from the Ministry of Information and Tourism was required for virtually all types of photography. Although the law has changed, police or security officials may still attempt to impose a fine on people taking photographs. It is forbidden to take photos of the Presidential Palace and its surroundings, military installations, airports, harbors, government buildings, and any other area deemed sensitive by the local government. Police and security officials have attempted to take photographers into custody for perceived or actual violations of this policy, or to seize the camera of persons photographing in the country. As these situations have the potential to become hostile, you should exercise prudence and caution while taking photographs.",
      "While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested in a foreign country, that might not always be the case. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas.",
      "Official Corruption: It is not uncommon for a uniformed member of the police or security forces to stop motorists on the pretext of minor or nonexistent violations of the local motor vehicle regulations in order to extort small bribes. Visitors are advised not to pay bribes, and to request that the officer provide a citation to be paid at the local court or a receipt stating the violation, amount due, and the officer’s name. If it appears that you may be asked to go to a police station or are held up at roadblocks for an extended period of time, you should contact the U.S. Embassy’s duty officer at +240 222-516-008 to report the situation.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Equatorial Guinea is almost exclusively a cash economy. The country has very few hotels that accept credit cards. Generally, credit cards and checks are not accepted, and credit card cash advances are not available. Most local businesses do not accept travelers' checks, dollars, or euros. However, dollars can be exchanged at local banks for Central African Francs (CFA). Cash in CFA is usually the only form of payment accepted throughout the country. ATMs are increasingly available in major cities, but their use is not widespread. Although they are generally secure, travelers may find them out of order, so it is best not to rely entirely on ATMs to obtain cash.",
      "WOMEN TRAVELER INFORMATION: If you are a woman traveling abroad, please review our information for women travelers .",
      "LGBT RIGHTS: There are very few openly Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) individuals in Equatorial Guinea. There are no laws criminalizing same-sex conduct and no reports of anti-LGBT violent attacks; however, societal stigmatization against the LGBT community is a problem. While discussions of sexual orientation and homosexuality are not completely taboo, and there are no legal impediments to LGBT lifestyles, LGBT lifestyles are not generally accepted. For further information on LGBT travel, please read our LGBT travel information .",
      "ACCESSIBILITY: While in Equatorial Guinea, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States . Accommodation for individuals with disabilities is not mandated by Equatoguinean law, and travelers with disabilities may encounter difficulties accessing transportation and public buildings. Although sidewalks often are available in major cities (especially in Malabo and Bata), road crossings are frequently uneven and curbs in need of repair. Neither Malabo nor Bata has a public transportation system, and few vehicles are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Public buildings, including restaurants, bars, medical facilities, stores, and government offices, are rarely accessible and frequently have steps or partially obstructed entrances.",

      "CRIME: Although violent crime is rare, there has been a rise in violent burglaries/home invasions and in overall hostility directed at westerners by police and other officials. Many situations, including petty or street crime and official harassment, have the potential to turn violent. U.S. citizens are advised to carry copies of their passports and other pertinent documents at all times. It may be useful to have notarized copies of biographical documents as these are often perceived by the authorities to be more official than non-notarized copies.",
      "Since July 2013, there has been a significant increase in attacks against women, including U.S. citizens, by small groups posing as taxi drivers and passengers. The attacks have been most severe in the continental city of Bata and surrounding areas, but have also occurred in Malabo. Victims typically are held captive for up to an hour, threatened at knife-point, and robbed. We strongly recommend taking taxis only in groups, using taxi drivers personally known to you, or avoiding the use of taxis altogether, especially in Bata. In August 2015, shortly after getting into a taxi, a non-U.S. citizen expatriate was robbed and raped on her way to the airport. In the same month, another expatriate was robbed by four locals while exiting a taxi at approximately 6:00 AM.",
      "You should avoid dark alleys, remote locations, and traveling alone. Sexual assault is rare against westerners. There is little evidence of racially-motivated hate crimes or crime targeted against elderly travelers or the LGBT community. Generally, the police are responsive to reports of crimes by U.S. citizens, but it is common to be asked to pay a substantial sum of money (between US $50 to $100) in order to file a police report or obtain a copy of a police report on file.",

If you are traveling on business, the Government of Equatorial Guinea may require a letter from your employer, stating the nature and duration of business. In addition, a certification of vaccination for small pox, yellow fever, and cholera are required to enter Equatorial Guinea. In practice, U.S. citizens are rarely asked to provide visa applications or evidence of access to funds, but it is increasingly common to be asked for proof of vaccination upon entrance.",

Detonations have occurred on relatively well-traveled roads in and near the Gash Barka region of western Eritrea. The roads between Asmara, Massawa, Mendefera, Dekemhare, Barentu, and Keren are paved but roads to small villages are not. Mountain roads, which are narrow and winding with crumbling edges, do not generally have guardrails or signs. Road debris is common during the rainy season from October to May. The Filfil Road from Asmara to Massawa has a large amount of mountain debris and has washed away in parts. Traffic safety is also hazardous due to excessive speed, slow motorized carts, pedestrians, bicycles, livestock, fog, and poor lighting.",

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in El Salvador, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning El Salvador is provided for general reference only, and may not be very accurate in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "Major highways and thoroughfares in El Salvador are among the best in Central America, but road conditions throughout El Salvador are not up to U.S. standards. Even within the city of San Salvador, it is common to see missing manhole covers and large objects in the roadway marking the danger. Road travel at night is particularly dangerous outside the capital as there are few road lights and many vehicles lack adequate safety lighting or reflectors. The Embassy advises against driving outside the capital during nighttime or periods of low visibility. Mini-buses, regular buses, and taxis are often poorly maintained. Drivers are frequently untrained and unlicensed, and generally do not adhere to traffic rules and regulations.",
      "Because of inconsistent enforcement of traffic laws in El Salvador, drivers must make an extraordinary effort to drive defensively. Passing on blind corners or across several lanes of traffic is commonplace. Two lane traffic circles are common in El Salvador and can be especially dangerous to navigate as it is generally understood that the traffic in the inside lane has right of way.",
      "The law in El Salvador requires all parties involved in a vehicle accident to stay at the scene until the police respond; however, it is not unusual in minor traffic accidents for both parties to simply drive away especially if one or both drivers are uninsured. Hit and run accidents are common. Salvadoran law requires that the driver of a vehicle that injures or kills another person must be arrested and detained until a judge can determine responsibility for the accident. This law is uniformly enforced.",
      "Visitors to El Salvador may drive with a U.S. driver’s license for up to 30 days. After that time, a visitor is required to obtain a Salvadoran license.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the web site of El Salvador’s national tourist office and the national authority responsible for road safety . Further information on traffic and road conditions is available in Spanish from Automovil Club de El Salvador (ACES) .",

      "There are few private and no public hospitals that meet U.S. commonly-accepted standards. The Embassy recommends that private hospitals be used only for emergency care to stabilize a condition prior to returning to the United States for definitive evaluation and treatment. Private hospitals and physicians expect up-front payment (cash or, for hospitals, credit card) for all bills as there are no hospitals or medical offices who will bill U.S. insurance companies.",
      "Priority Ambulance (503-2264-7911) is the only private ambulance service with a fleet of vehicles in San Salvador that has trained personnel and medical equipment to manage emergencies. The response time is often less than ideal because of the heavy traffic in San Salvador. Therefore, it is often quicker for people to transport themselves directly to the hospital by private vehicle.",
      "Pharmacies are plentiful, but not all medicines found in the United States are available in El Salvador. Medicines often have a different brand name and are frequently more expensive than in the United States. Recent regulatory changes that established price limits for all pharmaceuticals sold in El Salvador may affect quality and availability of certain medicines. We recommend that U.S. citizens traveling to El Salvador carry an adequate supply of any medication they require in its original container, which should be clearly labeled. A copy of the prescription from your doctor will be helpful in the event that immigration or customs authorities question you about your medications.",
      "Chikungunya, dengue and malaria are all mosquito borne illnesses that are present in El Salvador. Travelers should carry and use CDC recommended insect repellents containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 to help diminish bites from mosquitoes as well ticks, fleas, chiggers, etc, some of which may also carry infectious diseases.",
      "Zika Virus: Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact. The CDC has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects in some fetuses and babies born to infected mothers. For additional information about Zika, including travel advisories, visit the CDC website .",
      "Chikungunya and Dengue are becoming more frequent in tropical and equatorial climates around the world and there have been large outbreaks in El Salvador. Symptoms of the two illnesses are very similar and can include fever, rash, severe headache, joint pain, and muscle or bone pain. There are no specific treatments for Chikungunya or Dengue and vaccines are still in the developmental phase. Preventing mosquito bites is the most important way to prevent this illness. Avoidance and prevention techniques include: reducing mosquito exposure by using repellents, covering exposed skin, treating clothing and tents with permethrin and sleeping in screened or air conditioned rooms. You can also reduce exposure through mosquito control measures, including emptying water from outdoor containers and spraying to reduce mosquito populations. The Aedes mosquitos that carry these illnesses are primarily day biting and often live in homes and hotel rooms especially under beds, in bathrooms and closets. Malaria is now uncommon in ELSalvador but travelers to rural areas in the departments of Ahuachapán, Santa Ana, and La Unión should be aware of the potential for infection Plasmodium vivax , especially if they will be outdoors (camping, hiking) in these rural areas for a prolonged period. Routine travelers to El Salvador are NOT recommended to take malaria prophylaxis.",
      "Diarrheal illness is very common among travelers except those staying exclusively in luxury accommodation in Sal Salvador. Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through scrupulous washing of hands and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating. The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk. Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them. Drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice (because it may have been made from unclean water). Talk to your doctor about short course antibiotics and loperamide to take with you in case of diarrhea while traveling.",
      "All routinely recommended immunizations for the U.S. should be up to date. Measles, mumps, rubella , tetanus, pertussis and chickenpox are much more common than in the U.S., especially among children. Additionally, hepatitis A and typhoid immunization is recommended for all travelers. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all those who may have sexual contacts, tattoos or require medical treatment while in El Salvador.",

The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services. According to the National Council for Comprehensive Attention to Persons with Disability (CONAIPD) , the government does not allocate sufficient resources to enforce these prohibitions effectively, particularly in education, employment, and transportation, and does not effectively enforce legal requirements for access to buildings, information, and communications for persons with disabilities. There are almost no access ramps or provisions for the mobility of persons with sight and hearing disabilities."

      "CRIME: Tens of thousands of U.S. citizens safely visit El Salvador each year for study, tourism, cruise ship visits, business, and volunteer work. There is no information to suggest that U.S. citizens are specifically targeted by criminals; however, crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country. Since January 2010, 33 U.S. citizens were murdered in El Salvador, including a nine-year-old child in December 2013. During the same time period, 366 U.S. citizens reported having their passports stolen, while others were victims of violent crimes.",
      "Typical crimes in El Salvador include extortion, mugging, highway assault, home invasion, and car theft. Some victims unwittingly wander into gang-controlled territory andmay be targeted, normally at night. Assaults against police officers have risen, and public shootouts are not uncommon. Home invasions and/or burglaries of residences during broad daylight are prevalent in affluent residential neighborhoods in San Salvador. Some of these home invasions occur when individuals posing as deliverymen or as police officers gain access to a home. Armed robberies of climbers and hikers in El Salvador’s national parks are known to occur, and the Embassy strongly recommends engaging the services of a local guide certified by the national or local tourist authority when hiking in back-country areas -- even within the national parks. In 2000, the National Civilian Police (PNC) established a special tourist police force (POLITUR) to provide security and assistance to tourists. It has officers located in 19 tourist destinations.",
      "A majority of serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved; only 6 of the 33 murders of U.S. citizens since January 2010 have resulted in convictions. The Government of El Salvador lacks sufficient resources to properly investigate and prosecute cases and to deter violent crime. While several of the PNC’s investigative units have shown great promise, routine street level patrol techniques, anti-gang, and crime suppression efforts are limited. Equipment shortages (particularly radios, vehicles, and fuel) further limit their ability to deter or respond to crimes effectively.",
      "El Salvador, a country of roughly six million people, has, according to Government of El Salvador statistics, thousands of known gang members from several gangs including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Eighteenth Street (M18). Gang members are quick to engage in violence or use deadly force if resisted. These “maras” concentrate on narcotics and arms trafficking, murder for hire, car-jacking, extortion, and violent street crime. A significant number of disappearances are believed by authorities to be related to gang activity, since many of the missing are in gangs or are friends or family members of gang members. Police sources claim that the families of gang members often face the same risks of being killed or disappearing as the gang members themselves.",
      "Extortion is a particularly serious and very common crime in El Salvador. Some extortion attempts are no more than random cold calls that originate from imprisoned gang members using cellular telephones, and the subsequent threats against the victim are made through social engineering and/or through information obtained about the victim’s family. U.S. citizens who are visiting El Salvador for extended periods are at higher risk for extortion demands. . Many extortions are not reported by victims for fear of reprisal and lack of faith in the ability of the government to protect the victims.",
      "Travelers should remain in groups and avoid remote or isolated locations in order to minimize their vulnerability. Travelers should also avoid displaying or carrying valuables in public places. Passports and other important documents should not be left in private vehicles. U.S. Embassy security officials advise all U.S. Government personnel not to walk, run, or cycle in the unguarded streets and parks of El Salvador, even in groups, and recommend exercising only in gyms and fitness centers. Criminals often become violent quickly, especially when victims fail to cooperate immediately in surrendering valuables. Frequently, victims who argue with assailants or refuse to give up their valuables are shot. U.S. citizens in El Salvador should exercise caution at all times and practice good personal security procedures throughout their stay.",
      "Armed holdups of vehicles traveling on El Salvador's roads are common, and we encourage U.S. citizens to remain aware of their surroundings. The U.S. Embassy warns its personnel to drive with their doors locked and windows raised. Avoid travel outside of major metropolitan areas after dark and on unpaved roads at all times because of criminal assaults and lack of police and road service facilities. Armed assaults and carjackings take place both in San Salvador and in the interior of the country, but are especially frequent on roads outside the capital where police patrols are scarce. Criminals have been known to follow travelers from the El Salvador International Airport to private residences or secluded stretches of road where they carry out assaults and robberies. Armed robbers are known to shoot if the vehicle does not come to a stop. Travelers with conspicuous amounts of luggage, late-model cars, or foreign license plates are particularly vulnerable to crime, even in the capital.",
      "Travel on public transportation, especially buses, both within and outside the capital, is risky and not recommended. The Embassy advises official visitors and personnel to avoid using mini-buses and regular buses and to use only radio-dispatched taxis or those stationed in front of major hotels.",
      "U.S. citizens using banking services should be vigilant while conducting their financial exchanges either inside local banks or at automated teller machines (ATMs). Recently, there have been cases reported in which criminals observe and follow customers making withdrawals at ATMs and banks, and then rob them on the road or at a residence. U.S. citizens have also been victimized at well-known restaurants, hotels, and retailers within San Salvador. Credit card cloning and similar fraud is also common in El Salvador. . Using a credit card is safer than using an ATM card or Debit card to pay. With ATM or Debit cards, the money is transferred out of the account at the very moment of the transaction, and it is often not recoverable or contestable.",
      "For your security, we recommend the following to avoid becoming a victim of credit card fraud: notify the card issuer of your travel plans, check your statements frequently, limit the number of credit cards you have and/or carry with you, limit the locations that you regularly use your card(s), maintain direct visual contact with your credit cards at all times, and shred all receipts. If you become a victim of credit card fraud, contact your bank’s fraud hotline and cancel your card immediately. They will ask you for information and will usually then send you an affidavit to sign, affirming you did not make the charges.",

Put you in contact with the appropriate police authorities, and if you want us to, we can contact family members or friends. Help you understand the local criminal justice process and direct you to local attorneys; although, it is important to remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.",
      "Victims of crime should bear in mind that law enforcement resources are limited and judicial processes are uneven in El Salvador. Most crimes in the country (including murder) go unsolved, and the likelihood for redress through the judicial system is limited. As a result, only a small percentage of cases result in conviction.",

U.S. citizens and other eligible foreign nationals, who legally enter any of the four countries, may similarly travel among the four without obtaining additional visas or tourist entry permits for the other three countries. Immigration officials at the first port of entry determine the length of stay, up to a maximum period of 90 days.",

Foreigners “expelled” from any of the four countries are excluded from the entire CA-4 region. In isolated cases, the lack of clarity in the implementing details of the CA-4 Border Control Agreement has caused temporary inconvenience to some travelers and has resulted in others being fined more than 100 USD or being detained in custody for 72 hours or longer for immigration violations.",

Since non-emergency passports are printed in the United States, and not at the Embassy, citizens submitting applications in El Salvador should be prepared to wait approximately 10 business days for receipt of their new passports.

Even though central emergency rooms exist in most hospitals, patients are often sent to the facility that treats their specific medical condition (i.e., broken noses are sent to the ear, nose, and throat specialist rather than to the general practitioner). There are family practices in the Czech Republic that function like those in the United States, but they are located mostly in larger cities.",

Private specialists usually expect cash payment for health services, though some private facilities accept credit cards as well.

Hospitalization in the Czech Republic is much more liberal than in the United States; conditions that would be treated on an outpatient basis in the United States are often treated on an inpatient basis in the Czech Republic. Ambulance services are on par with U.S. standards. Response time is generally less than 15 minutes. Ambulance companies generally expect payment at the time of service. Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost thousands of dollars or more.

      "Road Conditions and Safety: The information below concerning the FSM may not be accurate in all locations and circumstances. Most roads in the FSM are in very poor condition; they are narrow and without sidewalks. All roads are used simultaneously by pedestrians, children playing, animals, and vehicles. Road conditions can worsen significantly after heavy rains, which occur frequently. There are very few street lights, so road visibility is difficult at night, and pedestrians may dress in dark clothing, making them especially hard to see. Roads outside of towns are mostly unpaved. Travel by bicycle is hampered by the lack of shoulders on the roads and the presence of many dogs on the island.",
      "There is no formal training in road safety or driving, so many drivers are unaware of road safety rules. Drivers often make sudden turns or stop without warning to chat with or pick up pedestrians. When traffic accidents happen, they often result in fatalities or serious injuries.",
      "Motorcyclists are required by law to wear helmets, though this is rarely enforced.",
      "Traffic Laws: Speed limits throughout the FSM are very low: 20-25 miles per hour (mph) in most places and 15 mph in school zones when children are present. It is not uncommon for drivers to drive at 5 to 10 mph, even when there is no traffic. Drivers may stop in the roadway without warning to talk to someone on the side of the road.",
      "Driving is on the right-hand side of the road, as in the United States. However, the majority of vehicles in FSM are right-hand drive vehicles imported from Japan. Drivers in these vehicles do not have an optimal field of vision, which can interfere with driving maneuvers and drivers’ ability to establish visual contact with other road users.",
      "If you intend to reside in the FSM, you should acquire a local driver’s license with the State Police. In most cases, the police will issue a local license to anyone who presents a U.S. driver’s license. If you will be in the FSM temporarily, a U.S. driver’s license itself is sufficient to rent a car and drive for the duration of your visit.",
      "Public Transportation: Taxis are available in state capitals, but you should always be careful since many taxi drivers are reckless.",

      "AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Micronesia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of the FSM’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page .",

There is only one alternative carrier, Air Nauru, limited to Pohnpei and Kosrae if flights are canceled or missed. Flights are often fully booked and aircraft weight is an issue due to short runways and the type of aircraft used. Be aware of these limitations and the numerous transit stops (typical routing to Kolonia, for instance, is via Honolulu with stops in Majuro, Kwajalein, and Kosrae; or via Guam with a stop in Chuuk). With passengers disembarking and embarking at each stop, baggage sometimes may not be loaded or may be off-loaded by mistake and left behind at an intermediate stop. You should keep these logistical challenges in mind when traveling in the region. Missing baggage should be reported immediately to United Airlines ground personnel before onward flight."

Medical evacuation assistance for non-ambulatory patients will take a minimum of 12 hours to arrive and can be expensive. There are no daily commercial flights, and flights often sell out, so finding last-minute seats is difficult. Scuba divers should note that although there are decompression chambers in Yap, Chuuk, and Pohnpei, they are generally not in working order, and local staff may not have adequate experience in treating diving injuries.",

Travelers are routinely stopped at police checkpoints within cities and on roads to the interior. You should comply politely if stopped, but avoid encouraging requests for bribery. Use extreme caution when driving after dark. Two-lane roads are the norm throughout Gabon. Roads to outlying cities are usually unpaved. There are many dangers, including large potholes, absence of road signs, poor-to-non-existent streetlights, timber-laden trucks, and the presence of pedestrians and animals. Construction work is generally poorly indicated. Drivers may change lanes or stop unexpectedly. Lane markings are frequently ignored. Four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended for travel beyond the paved road to Lambarene, especially during the rainy season.",

The police may verify that you have all of the required documentation and equipment if they stop you on the road or at police checkpoints.

Use a hotel taxi when possible. Before entering a taxi, check that the taxi has seatbelts and negotiate the rate for your trip. Bus service exists in Libreville, but buses are infrequent and routes are not generally convenient. Rail service remains available but infrequent, and travelers should expect lengthy delays.",

      "Primary roads are generally paved and well maintained.However, some side roads within major cities and many roads outside of major cities are in poor condition.The road from Accra to the central region tourist area of Cape Coast continues to be the site of many accidents.Travel after daylight hours, particularly outside the major cities, is extremely hazardous due to poor street lighting and the unpredictable behavior of pedestrians, bicyclists and farm animals, particularly goats and sheep.Aggressive drivers, poorly maintained vehicles, and overloaded vehicles pose serious threats to road safety.",
      "Another hazard is pedestrians who intentionally bump vehicles and pretend to be hit. They then attempt to extort money from the vehicle occupants.Scams of this nature most commonly occur in congested urban areas.",
      "The safety standards of the small private buses that transit roads and highways are uncertain.Travelers are encouraged to consider this when making travel arrangements.",
      "Armed robbers have targeted travelers following their arrival at Kotoka airport.An increasingly used tactic is to deliberately cause a minor road traffic accident to make a car stop, and to then rob the occupants.If your car is hit by another car it is best to drive to the nearest police station to sort out the incident.Otherwise, all drivers, particularly at night, should remain vigilant, and drive with doors locked and windows up.",
      "There has been an increase in incidents of highway robbery on the road from Kintampo to Tamale in the Brong Ahafo and Northern regions.Travelers along this route should exercise caution.",
      "Travelers are routinely stopped at police checkpoints throughout Ghana, and vehicles and passengers may be searched.Drivers must possess an international driver’s license (available from AAA and the American Automobile Touring Alliance).There have been incidences of fraud related to international drivers’ licenses.As a result, when foreign drivers apply for their Ghanaian driver’s license they may be asked to have their international driver’s license or their home country driver’s license confirmed by their embassy.The U.S. Embassy in Ghana is unable to authenticate such state issued or international drivers’ licenses and advises U.S. citizen to contact the National Identification Authority in Ghana or have their U.S. driver’s license authenticated in the U.S. prior to arriving in Ghana.Foreign nationals should carry documentation of their status, such as a passport and a visa.",

      "Dengue fever causes fever, chills, severe headache and body aches.There is currently no vaccine or treatment for dengue and the illness occasionally causes severe or fatal disease.",
      "Diarrheal illness is very common among travelers even in large cities and luxury accommodations.Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through scrupulous washing of hands and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating.The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food.Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk (see Food &amp; Water Safety ).Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet.Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them. Drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice (because it may have been made from unclean water).Talk to your doctor about short course antibiotics and loperamide to take with you in case of diarrhea while traveling.",
      "All routinely recommended immunizations for the United States should be up to date. Measles, mumps, rubella , tetanus, pertussis , and chickenpox are much more common than in the United States, especially among children.Additionally, hepatitis A and typhoid immunization is recommended for all travelers.Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all those who may have sexual contacts, tattoos or require medical treatment while in Ghana.",
      "Rabies immunization is recommended for all travelers staying for more than four weeks or who will have remote, rural travel or expect animal exposure.Even in urban areas dogs may have rabies and bites and scratches from dogs, bats or other mammals should be immediately cleaned with soap and water and medical evaluation sought to determine if additional rabies immunization is warranted.",
      "Meningococcal meningitis is much more common than in the United States and immunization with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine should be given to all children and health care workers, it should be considered for all adults.",

      "Schistosomiasis is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread by fresh water snails.The larval stage of the worm can burrow through your skin when in contact with contaminated fresh water. Avoid wading, swimming, bathing, or washing in, or drinking from bodies of fresh water such as canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs.",
      "To date there have been no confirmed cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Ghana, but the government has developed a plan with the World Health Organization for EVD preparedness.",
      "Motor vehicle accidents, drownings, and water-related accidents due to Ghana’s rough surf have been reported by U.S. citizens.Muggings, and other violent attacks, as well as the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases – including HIV – are health and safety concerns that have been reported by U.S. citizens and can be at least partially mitigated by using common-sense safety precautions. Air quality is frequently unhealthy. Travelers to Accra should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. People with lung disease and those at extremes of age should avoid prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion on days when air quality is unhealthy.",

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Ghana, you are subject to its laws. Foreign laws and legal systems can be significantly different than our own and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. In some places you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you. In some places, it is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. In some places, driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. These criminal penalties will vary from country to country. There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States, and you can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you buy pirated goods. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime prosecutable in the United States . If you break local laws in Ghana, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not wherever you go.",
      "Persons violating Ghanaian laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Ghana are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. The use of illegal drugs procured in Ghana may have life-threatening consequences. There have been several deaths of U.S. citizens resulting from the use of narcotics procured locally.",
      "Arrest notifications in host country: While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested in that country, others may not. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Visitors arriving or departing Ghana with more than $5,000 USD in cash are required to declare the amount at the border. Currency exchange is available at most banks and at licensed foreign exchange bureaus, but currency transactions with private citizens are illegal. The Government of Ghana also prohibits departing travelers from carrying more than 500 new Ghana Cedis out of the country. Ghanaian currency must either be spent or exchanged before departure, or it will be confiscated.",
      "Strict customs regulations govern temporary importation into or export from Ghana of items such as gold, diamonds and precious natural resources. Only agents licensed by the Ghana Precious Minerals Marketing Commission (www.pmmcghana.com), telephone (233)(030) 266-4931 or 266-4579 , may handle import-export transactions of these natural resources. Any transaction without the commission’s endorsement is illegal and/or fraudulent. All transactions must be completed through the commission at the price set daily by the London exchange. Any transaction that discounts this price, or includes a previously negotiated price, is either illegal or fraudulent. Export of gold dust is rare as it encourages dangerous and environmentally destructive practices, and transactions involving the export of gold dust are likely fraudulent. Attempts to evade regulations are punishable by imprisonment. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of Ghana in Washington, D.C., or one of the Ghanaian consulates in the United States, for specific information regarding customs requirements.",
      "In rare instances, visitors arriving in Ghana with sophisticated electronic equipment (e.g., video cameras and laptop computers) may have to deposit 17.5 percent of the item's value with the Customs and Excise office at the airport. To get the deposit refunded, visitors must apply to the Customs and Excise Office in central Accra 48 hours before departure.",
      "Taking pictures near sensitive installations, including military sites and some government buildings, is prohibited. These sites are not always clearly marked and application of these restrictions is subject to interpretation. Permission may be obtained from Ghanaian security personnel. Permission should also be obtained before photographing anyone in uniform (e.g., police and military officers). In some cases, film and cameras have been confiscated. For security reasons, taking photographs of the U.S. Embassy is also prohibited.",
      "It is strictly prohibited to wear any military apparel such as camouflage jackets or trousers, or any clothing or items that may appear military in nature.",
      "WOMEN TRAVELER INFORMATION: If you are a woman traveling abroad, please review our tips for Women Travelers .",
      "LGBT RIGHTS: Ghana’s criminal code outlaws “unnatural carnal knowledge” which is sometimes interpreted by local authorities as consensual same-sex sexual relations and is criminalized as a misdemeanor in Ghana. The U.S. Embassy is aware of two arrests and related extortion attempts for such activities, but has received no reports of prosecutions. For more detailed information about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) rights in Ghana, you may review the State Department’s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices . For further information on LGBT travel, please read our LGBT Travel Information page.",
      "ACCESSIBILITY: While in Ghana, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. Ghana’s Persons with Disabilities Act (2006) explicitly prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, health care, air travel and other transportation, and other domains. The government does not systematically or overtly discriminate against persons with disabilities, but such persons may experience societal discrimination. The law provides persons with disabilities access to public buildings “as far as is practical.” However, most buildings, transportation, and educational facilities do not provide for people with special needs. Because many streets are not well maintained or unpaved, and sidewalks are not prevalent, individuals in wheelchairs or who have difficulty walking face challenges."

      "CRIME: Pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, and financial scams are the most common forms of crime confronting visitors. Travelers have reported these types of theft in taxis, at crowded markets, beaches, parks, and tourist attractions. Incidences of violent crime, such as armed robbery, are on the rise, including reports of armed robberies in expatriate residential and shopping areas, some beaches (including Kokrobite), and, specifically, the Osu and Ablekuma/Dzorwulu neighborhoods after 10 p.m. Victims who resist attackers face a significant risk of serious physical injury. Take security measures, such as traveling in groups and avoiding travel at night. Avoid travel in communal taxis. Travelers who limit their display of jewelry and handle their cash discreetly reduce their vulnerability to crime. Pay close attention to those around you or following you, particularly after exchanging money, making a purchase, or withdrawing money from an ATM. Travelers should carry limited amounts of cash and only photocopies of key documents.",
      "Thefts of both luggage and travel documents occur at Kotoka International Airport in Accra and in hotels across Ghana. All U.S. citizens should ensure that documents are kept secure at all times (including when leaving the airport) and that baggage is never left unattended. Travelers should be wary of all offers of unsolicited assistance at the airport unless from uniformed porters or officials. All permanent staff at the airport are issued current ID cards bearing their name and photograph. ID cards without a photograph are not valid. Travelers who are met at the airport should confirm the identity of their driver, either by requesting proper identification or otherwise verifying that the driver is an official from an organization or a hotel. There have been increasing incidences of impostors who approach travelers before the main arrivals area claiming to be the traveler's driver or contact. The impostor will have obtained the traveler's name from the board displayed by the official driver in the arrivals area outside the airport. The impostor then attempts to extort money from the traveler once the traveler is in the impostor's vehicle.",
      "Use of credit cards in Ghana should be avoided if possible, as a growing number of travelers have been victims of credit card fraud.",
      "In recent years, U.S. citizens have reported substantial financial losses from questionable transactions involving gold and other precious metals. The Government of Ghana maintains strict regulations on these natural resources. All agents must be licensed and all transactions must be certified. (See Special Circumstances below.)",
      "Perpetrators of business fraud often target foreigners, including U.S. citizens. Such fraud schemes are now prevalent throughout West Africa, including Ghana. Please refer to the Country Commercial Guide for Ghana for further information.",
      "U.S. citizens frequently consult the U.S. Embassy regarding questionable business offers sent from Ghana. These are scams and typically begin with an unsolicited communication (usually by e-mail) from an unknown individual who describes a situation that promises quick financial gain, often by assisting in the transfer of a large sum of money or valuables out of the country. A series of “advance fees” must be paid in order to conclude the transaction, such as fees to open a bank account or to pay certain taxes. In fact, the final payoff does not exist; the purpose of the scam is simply to collect money from the victim. The Embassy has also received reports of fraudulent charities soliciting contributions through the Internet or direct mail. If you receive such business offers or charity requests, check with the U.S. Embassy in Ghana ((233)-(030)-274-1570) for an assessment of the offer’s credibility before you commit any funds, provide any goods or services, or undertake any travel.",
      "Another type of fraud is committed by persons claiming to live in Ghana or traveling to Ghana on business, and who profess friendship or romantic interest over the Internet. Once a relationship has been established, the correspondent typically asks the U.S. citizen to send money for living expenses, travel expenses, visa costs or family emergencies. Sometimes a “hospital” or “doctor” telephones to say that the friend has suffered an “accident” and needs immediate financial assistance to cover medical bills. There are other variations of this scam, but the common goal is to fraudulently obtain as much money as possible from the victim. U.S. citizens have reported losing thousands of dollars through such scams. The anonymity of the Internet means that the victim cannot be sure of the real name, age, marital status, nationality, or even gender of the correspondent. In most cases reported to the Embassy, the correspondent turned out to be a fictitious persona created to lure U.S. citizens into sending money.",
      "Visitors to Ghana should also be wary of overly-friendly locals offering tours, discounted lodging, or other services that seem too good to be true. Tourists are often targeted by touts and scam artists. Some U.S. citizens have been victims of false criminal accusations and have lost time and money as they seek to resolve these difficult situations.",

Grenada’s roads, paved and unpaved, are mostly narrow and winding, with many blind corners, narrow or no shoulders, and steep drops into the sea on Grenada’s three islands. There are few sidewalks, and vehicles vie with pedestrians for road space. Road lighting varies on all three islands, which compounds the dangers at night. Driving conditions in Grenada, including road conditions, increased numbers of vehicles, and sometimes aggressive minibus drivers all require caution and reduced speed for safety. The Government of Grenada has a seat belt law; drivers and passengers found not wearing seat belts are subject to a fine of EC$1,000 (US$400).",
      "Before you drive in Grenada, a local temporary driver’s license, based on a valid U.S. driver’s license and costing EC$30 (US$12), is highly recommended. In the event of an accident, not having a valid local driver’s license will result in a fine, regardless of who is at fault. Rental vehicle companies are available; most of them will assist in applying for temporary driver’s licenses. The adequacy of road signage varies, but is generally poor to nonexistent.",

      "Road Conditions and Safety: Driving in Guatemala requires one’s full attention, and all drivers must take extraordinary efforts to drive defensively to avoid dangerous situations.",
      "Traffic Laws: Traffic rules are only casually observed. Many drivers do not use their turn signals to alert other drivers. Instead, a common custom is for a driver or passenger to stick a hand out the window and wave it to indicate that they will be taking an unspecified action. Passing blindly on winding and/or steep mountain roads, poorly designed surfaces, and unmarked hazards, such as frequent landslides and precarious temporary highway repairs present additional risks to motorists.",
      "All drivers involved in accidents resulting in injury may be detained and held in protective custody pending investigation or payment of alleged damages.",
      "Public Transportation: The most common form of public transportation is the system of bright red recycled school buses, which serve almost every town in the country. Criminal activity and frequent fatal accidents, however, make these low-priced local and inter-city buses particularly dangerous.",
      "Use of radio-dispatched taxis is far safer than hailing taxis on the street. In Guatemala City several radio taxi companies operate. Taxi Seguro can be reached at 2312-4243, but may not always be available, especially late at night. Taxi Amarillo Express (yellow taxis) is a radio-dispatch taxi service reached by dialing 1766. A Green Cab radio dispatch service operates in the suburbs near zone 15 and the Cayala entertainment and shopping destination. The Guatemalan tourist assistance agency, PROATUR, may be able to provide additional information, and can be reached by dialing 1500.",
      "Although city streets are usually well lit, secondary and rural roads have little to no illumination. Driving outside of urban areas at night is dangerous and not recommended. The Inter-American Highway (CA-1) and the road from Guatemala City to the Caribbean coast (CA-9) are especially dangerous both day and night, due to heavy traffic, including large trucks and trailers. There are no roadside assistance clubs; however, a roadside assistance force (PROVIAL) patrols most of the major highways in the country. PROVIAL can be contacted by calling 2419-2121. Their vehicles are equipped with basic tools and first aid supplies, and their services are free. Police patrol the major roadways and may assist travelers, but the patrols are sporadic and may be suspended due to budget constraints. For roadside assistance, travelers may call the police by dialing 110 or 120 or the fire department by dialing 122 or 123. Cellular telephone service covers most areas frequented by tourists.",
      "Road hazards are common and cars and trucks are often stalled in travel lanes or parked unattended in the middle of the road. Tree branches are sometimes placed in the road before the stalled vehicle to warn approaching traffic of the hazard. While driving in or near large cities, be vigilant of pedestrians who unexpectedly dart across roads, even in heavy traffic, due to the lack of defined cross walks.",
      "Highway Safety: There have been numerous reports of violent criminal activity along Guatemala’s main highways, including the Carretera a El Salvador (Inter-American Highway CA-2). In addition, travelers using alternate routes out of Antigua have reported armed assaults in recent years. There has also been an increase in alcohol-related traffic accidents on this same road at night. U.S. Embassy employees are strongly discouraged from driving at night. Embassy employees are also prohibited from driving from or through Mexico and Belize to Guatemala.",
      "The main road to Lake Atitlán via the Inter-American Highway (CA-1) and Sololá is safer than the alternative secondary roads near the lake. Specifically, the main road is preferable to the alternative road through Las Trampas and Godinez to Panajachel (RN-11) where robbery, rape, and assault have occurred in the past. Armed attacks have occurred on roads between Guatemala City and the Petén region as well as between Tikal and the Belize border. Visitors to the Mayan ruins at Tikal are urged to fly to nearby Flores and then travel by bus or tour van to the site. Violent attacks have occurred in the Mayan ruins in the Petén region, including in the Cerro Cahui Conservation Park, Yaxha, the road to and inside Tikal Park, and in the Tikal ruins, particularly during early morning sunrise tours of the ruins. Tourist police (POLITUR) patrols, however, have significantly reduced the incidence of violent crime inside the park and there have been no reports of armed assaults on tourists there since October of 2012. Travelers should remain in groups, stay on the principal trails leading to the Central Plaza and the Temple IV complex, and avoid remote areas of the park.",
      "Robberies of occupied vehicles are becoming more common in Guatemala City. Often two assailants are on motorcycles and pull up alongside a car stopped at a traffic light.",
      "Rules of the road: Valid U.S. driver’s licenses are accepted for the first 30 days of a visit, and international driving permits are accepted in Guatemala for extended stays. Drivers use the right-hand side of the road in Guatemala, and speed limits are posted (in kilometers) depending on the condition of the road. Speed limits are rarely enforced, and drivers often drive at the absolute maximum speed their vehicle can handle at that particular time. These drivers share the road with slow vehicles, some barely able to manage 20 miles per hour, creating a hazardous mix of velocities. Turning right on red is not permitted unless otherwise posted, and drivers must yield when entering a traffic circle. Seat belts must be worn in Guatemala, but there are no laws regarding the use of child safety seats. It is against the law for drivers to operate cellular phones while driving but cell phone usage while driving in city traffic remains commonplace.",
      "People found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs are arrested and may serve jail time.",

      "The U.S. government does not pay medical bills. Many hospitals in Guatemala require payment prior to treating patients, even if personal insurance will cover the treatment. They do not typically enter into payment plan agreements. Travelers should be aware that they may have to pay in advance and seek reimbursement.

Antidiscrimination laws exist, but do not include specific protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity. According to LGBTI rights groups, gay and transgender individuals often experience police abuse. LGBTI rights groups allege that police officers regularly engage in extortion by waiting outside clubs and bars frequented by LGBTI persons to demand that those engaged in sexual activities pay protection money or pay to avoid jail. A lack of trust in the judicial system and a fear of further harassment or social recrimination discourage victims from filing complaints. There is general societal discrimination against LGBTI persons in access to education, health care, employment, and housing. For further information on LGBTI travel, please read our Information for LGBTI Travelers page and section 6 of the Department of State’s Human Rights report .",

      "Customs: Guatemalan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Guatemala of items such as antiquities and other cultural property. You should declare any amount of cash exceeding 10,000 USD that you bring into the country or the money may be confiscated by the authorities. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of Guatemala in Washington, D.C. or one of Guatemala’s consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.",
      "Marriage: Non-Guatemalan citizens who wish to marry in Guatemala are required to provide proof of identity and civil status (indicating whether they are single or divorced). Prior notice of the marriage must be given in the Diario de Centro América (Guatemala's Official Record) and any large-circulation daily newspaper for 15 days. The marriage must take place within six months of the publication of the notice or the publication loses validity and a new one is required with additional expense.",
      "Suspicion of Outsiders: Particularly in small villages, residents are often wary and suspicious of outsiders. In the past, Guatemalan citizens have been lynched for suspicion of child abduction, so we recommend that U.S. citizens keep a distance from local children, and refrain from actions that could fuel such suspicions. In addition, U.S. citizens are advised to be aware of and to avoid activities that might unintentionally violate a cultural or religious belief.",
      "Beaches and Lakes: Beware of strong currents, riptides, and undertow along Guatemala's Pacific coast beaches. They pose a serious threat to even the strongest swimmers. Signs warning of treacherous surf are rare and confined mostly to private beaches owned by hotels. Lifeguards are rarely present on beaches. Lake Atitlan, one of the most popular tourist destinations, is deep enough to have dangerous undercurrents.",
      "Volcanic Activity: There are currently four active volcanoes in Guatemala. Volcanic activity has on occasion forced evacuations of nearby villages. Tourists planning to climb the Pacaya and/or Agua volcanoes during Guatemala’s rainy season (May through October) should plan their climb for the morning hours when thunderstorms are less likely to occur. Climbers should monitor the weather situation and return to the base of the volcano as quickly and safely as possible if thunderstorms gather. INGUAT has organized an active community-based tourism program in San Vicente Pacaya to minimize the risk of armed robbery on Pacaya. In February 2016, the Embassy issued a security message putting the Agua volcano off limits to Embassy personnel due to the high incidence of roberries on the volcano. Climbing volcanoes in groups is still highly advisable to reduce the risk of robbery and assault.",
      "Earthquakes: Guatemala is a geologically active country. Visitors should be aware of the possibility of earthquakes at any time and make contingency plans.",
      "Storms: Both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Guatemala are vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms from mid-May through November. Mudslides and flooding during the May to November rainy season often kill dozens of people and close roads. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available locally from the National Disaster Reduction Coordination Office (CONRED) and from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Please consult CONRED for updates on natural disasters or tropical storms and hurricanes."

    "safety": [
      "Crime: The threat of violent crime in Guatemala is rated by the U.S. Department of State as “critical.” The Embassy has no reason to believe that U.S. citizens are being specifically targeted, although criminals in Guatemala may assume that U.S. citizens and their relatives have more money than average Guatemalans.",
      "The number of violent crimes reported by U.S. citizens and other foreigners has remained high and such crimes have occurred even in areas of Guatemala City once considered safe, such as Zones 10, 14, 15, and 16. Due to large scale drug and alien smuggling, the Guatemalan border with Mexico (and in particular the northwestern corner of Petén) is a high-risk area. The border areas including the Sierra de Lacandon and Laguna del Tigre National Parks are among the most dangerous areas in Guatemala. The U.S. Embassy takes extra precautions when U.S. government personnel travel to the region. Reports of sexual assault remain high. Women should be especially careful when traveling alone and avoid staying out late without an escort. Support for victims of sexual assault is lacking outside of major cities, and there are not enough trained personnel who can help victims either in the capital or outlying areas. Theft, armed robbery, and carjacking are the most common crimes against U.S. citizens who visit Guatemala. To decrease the likelihood of becoming a victim, do not display items of value such as laptops, iPods, iPads, cameras, or jewelry and refrain from using a cell phone on the street. Carry a photocopy of your passport when out and about to avoid losing it during a robbery. A number of travelers have experienced carjackings and armed robberies as they drive away from the airport after arriving on international flights. Victims have been killed when they resisted an attack or refused to give up their money or other valuables. Pickpockets and purse-snatchers are prevalent in major cities and tourist sites, especially the central market and other parts of Zone 1 in Guatemala City. For security reasons, the Embassy does not recommend U.S. government employees stay in hotels in Zone 1 and urges private travelers to avoid staying in this area. In a common scenario, an accomplice distracts the victim while an assailant slashes or simply steals a bag or backpack. The Embassy advises tourists and residents to be very vigilant of their surroundings and report any crime incidents promptly to the police. We strongly encourage you not to use public ATMs.",
      "Scams involving attempts to acquire a victim’s ATM card and personal identification number (PIN) are common. U.S. citizens have also been victims of credit card scams where the card is copied and used improperly or where the citizen has been the recipient of inflated charges. Credit card copying can also lead to identify theft. Extortion calls and grandparent scams are common in Guatemala. For additional information, please read our information on International Financial Scams . If in doubt whether a caller is legitimate, call the U.S. Embassy at 011-(502) 2326-4501. Avoid low-priced public intra- and inter-city buses (often recognizable as recycled and repainted U.S. school buses). U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to use any local buses. Public buses are subject to frequent attacks by armed robbers and often are poorly maintained and dangerously driven. Do not hail taxis on the street in Guatemala City. For shorter trips, the safest options are radio-dispatched taxis (Taxi Amarillo), INGUAT approved taxis from the “SAFE” stand from the airport or hotel taxis.",
      "The introduction of modern inter-city buses with prepaid fares has somewhat improved the security and safety of inter-city bus passengers; however, several travelers have even been attacked on first-class buses on highway CA-2 near the border areas with both Mexico and El Salvador, on highways CA-1 and CA-9 near the border with El Salvador, and in the highlands between Quetzaltenango and Sololá.",
      "Security escorts for tourist groups and security information are available from the Tourist Assistance Office (PROATUR) of INGUAT (the Guatemalan Tourism Institute) at 7a Avenida 1-17. Zona 4, Centro Civico, Guatemala City. INGUAT’s PROATUR division has 24-hour/seven days per week direct telephone numbers for tourist assistance and emergencies. You may call them at (502) 2421-2810, fax them at (502) 2421-2891, or simply dial 1500 in Guatemala to reach INGUAT Tourist Assistance. You can also request the service by e-mail at operacionesproatur@inguat.gob.gt .",
      "PROATUR also maintains regional offices in all major tourist destinations in Guatemala, and the regional delegates provide rapid and appropriate assistance to crime and accident victims. Travelers may also wish to visit INGUAT’s web site . Tourist groups are advised to request security escorts from INGUAT. There have been no incidents of armed robbery of groups escorted through the Tourist Protection Program. The request should be submitted by mail, fax, or e-mail and should arrive at INGUAT at least three business days in advance of the proposed travel. Requests should be directed to the attention of the Coordinator of the National Tourist Assistance Program, and should provide the itinerary, names of travelers, and model and color of the vehicle in which they will be traveling. Travelers should be aware that INGUAT might not be able to accommodate all requests.",
      "Travelers should be aware that basic safety measures and precautions commonly required in the United States for swimming, boating and other outdoor activities may not be observed in Guatemala. Additionally, crime incidents have occurred on both land and waterways, with multiple boaters in the Rio Dulce area of the Department of Izabal having been victims in violent armed attacks while aboard boats.",
      "Demonstrations: Large demonstrations occur throughout Guatemala, often with little or no advance notice, and can cause serious traffic disruptions. Although most demonstrations are peaceful, they can turn violent, and travelers should avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place. When acts of violence are particularly severe, such as those caused by drug traffickers in the Petén region, a state of siege can be declared by the authorities. That likely means a curfew will be set and increased police patrols in the areas affected. U.S. citizens traveling through these places should be very cautious, cooperate with the authorities and stay indoors after the curfew.",
      "Keep informed of possible demonstrations by following the local news and consulting the Embassy’s web page and hotel personnel and tour guides.",
      "Indigenous Areas: Please be mindful of local traditional practices when visiting indigenous Mayan communities as tensions can rise quickly and locals occasionally take the law into their own hands",

That period can be extended for an additional 90 days upon application to Guatemalan immigration (If the initial period of stay granted upon entry is less than 90 days, any extension would be granted only for the same number of days as the initial authorization). U.S. citizen travelers should have at least 6 months of validity remaining on their U.S. passports after the date of entry or they may be turned back by the airline or immigration.",
      "Fines of approximately 1.30 USD per day are exacted for overstaying visas. In June 2006, Guatemala entered a “Central America-4 (CA-4) Border Control Agreement” with El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Under the terms of the agreement, citizens of the four countries may travel freely across land borders from one of the countries to any of the others without completing entry and exit formalities at immigration checkpoints. U.S. citizens and other eligible foreign nationals who legally enter any of the four countries may similarly travel among the four without obtaining additional visas or tourist entry permits for the other three countries. Immigration officials at the first port of entry determine the length of stay, up to a maximum period of 90 days. Foreign tourists who wish to remain in the region beyond the period initially granted for their visit are required either to request a one-time extension of stay from local immigration authorities in the country where the traveler is physically present, or to travel outside the CA-4 countries and reapply for admission to the region.",

      "Drivers in Guinea routinely ignore road safety rules. Guinea's road network, which is only partly paved, is underdeveloped and unsafe. Roads and vehicles are poorly maintained, road signs are insufficient, and roads and vehicles are frequently unlit. Livestock and pedestrians create constant road hazards and make nighttime travel inadvisable. The police and the military often set up roadblocks, making inter/intra-city travel difficult from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. During the rainy season (July through September), flash floods make some roads temporarily impassable. There is also a significant increase in banditry along the roadways between towns and upcountry during evening hours. U.S. citizens and other foreigners are strongly discouraged from traveling after dark outside of populated areas. Roadside assistance is not available in Guinea.",
      "Guinea has no reliable safe public transportation. Taxis, including small cars and larger vans, are often poorly maintained and overcrowded.

The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk (see Food &amp; Water Safety ). Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them. Drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice (because it may have been made from unclean water).",

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Guinea, you are subject to its laws. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different than our own. There are also some things that may be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. For example, you can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you buy pirated goods. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is also a crime prosecutable in the United States . If your break the local laws in Guinea, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It is very important to know what is legal and what is not legal where you are going. Persons violating Guinean laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Guinea are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. It is common for criminal cases to take months, if not years, to reach a verdict.",
      "Arrest Notifications in Host Country: While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested, others may not. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if you are arrested or detained overseas.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Guinean customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning the temporary import or export of items such as firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, and ivory. You should contact the Embassy of Guinea in Washington (see contact information above in the Entry Requirements section) for specific information regarding customs requirements.",
      "The local currency is the Guinean franc (FG). Travelers may not depart Guinea carrying more than 100,000 FG (currently about $14.00 USD) or more than $5,000 USD dollars. Guinea has a cash economy. ATMs are mostly unavailable, and traveler’s checks are accepted only at some banks and hotels. Credit cards are accepted at some larger hotels in Conakry, but should be used only at reputable hotels and banks. Cash advances on Visa credit cards are available at various branches of BICIGUI, a local bank. Inter-bank fund transfers are possible at BICIGUI branches but can be difficult and expensive. Money transfers from the United States have worked successfully in the past. Western Union has several offices in Conakry, and MoneyGram has an office in downtown Conakry as well.",
      "Visitors should restrict photography to private gatherings and should obtain explicit permission from the Guinean government before photographing military and transportation facilities, government buildings, or public works.

      "Guinea’s first democratically elected President was inaugurated in December 2010, with the next election scheduled to be held in October 2015. The presidential election was supposed to be followed by timely elections for the national legislature, but was repeatedly delayed causing demonstrations and protests, some of which became violent and resulted in loss of life. In addition, electricity outages have exacerbated unrest and led to demonstrations in some neighborhoods. In both cases, demonstrators attempted to block traffic and caused property damage. Travelers should note that even the most disciplined demonstration could devolve into unpredictable, scattered, independent actions. While the Embassy attempts to alert U.S. citizens in the country to potential safety and security events in advance, this is not always possible with fast-breaking developments.",
      "While not specifically targeted, U.S. citizens have been victims of crime. Motorists traveling outside of Conakry have encountered improvised checkpoint-barricades manned by persons in military uniforms who demand money and search through personal belongings, confiscating items of value. On rare occasions, persons, including U.S. citizens, have reported abusive treatment by security forces and being taken into custody for purposes of extortion.",
      "Civilian groups occasionally stage impromptu strikes or demonstrations, a practice that usually takes place when legislative elections occur. In some instances and in some locales, these demonstrations may involve violence. While U.S. citizens have not been targeted in past outbreaks of violence, being in the wrong place at the wrong time can be very dangerous. During periods of civil unrest, public services such as transportation and medical care, as well as the availability of goods and services, can be affected. During many demonstrations, crowds of people gather and burn tires, create roadblocks, and damage vehicles by throwing rocks and bricks. The military has also been known to demonstrate and incite unrest due to their grievances with the government. U.S. citizens should avoid large crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations. They should also avoid sensitive government installations, including the Presidential Palace, official government buildings, and military bases. U.S. citizens should maintain security awareness at all times.",
      "Most border crossings are controlled jointly by Guinean armed forces, gendarmes, police, and immigration officials but are lightly patrolled because of the length of the land borders, and the military’s lack of physical and monetary resources.

      "CRIME: Guinea is pro-United States and pro-West, in general. However, expatriates and members of the diplomatic community are exposed to the realities of the criminal threat without consideration of nationality or affiliation. Several diplomats and expatriates have been victimized by residential burglaries and vehicle break-ins. These crimes are not uncommon and the risks are assumed across the spectrum of those perceived to have some level of wealth. Routine personal security considerations such as locking doors, windows, and employing technological security measures can significantly reduce exposure to risk. Careful consideration of means of transportation, and specific times and locations deemed dangerous may also help reduce the instances of crime.",
      "Travelers should avoid unsolicited offers of assistance at the airport or hotels as these individuals may be seeking opportunities to rob visitors of their bags, purses, or wallets. Security at Gbessia International Airport was nearly non-existent several years ago. However, the creation of a new modern terminal, use of access badges, and heightened security has improved the situation. Visitors who arrange to be met at the airport by hotel personnel or business contacts can reduce vulnerability to these crimes. Commercial scams and disputes with local business partners have occasionally created legal difficulties for U.S. citizens. The ability of the U.S. Embassy to extricate U.S. citizens from unlawful business deals is extremely limited. The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy.",
      "It is essential to keep car doors locked at all times. Failure to do so has resulted in carjacking and vehicle intrusion. It is also advisable to keep windows up, and to only roll them down enough to communicate when necessary. Soldiers staffing checkpoints at night and police at intersections during the day will often solicit bribes. Display requested documents, but do not surrender them, as officials may take them if bribes are not paid. Travelers may wish to keep a laminated copy of their documents with them that can be shown in place of their actual passports or identification cards.",
      "Computer scams are also on the rise usually by email solicitation or fax. These scams target private business personnel and non-governmental organization employees. In general, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stay away from these scams; many business personnel have lost large quantities of money and have put themselves in danger by engaging in such deals.",
      "Political Violence: Guinea has experienced over three years of relative political calm. After enduring a tumultuous recent past politically, Guinea has taken steps in furtherance of a more stable democracy. In 2013 Guinea held legislative elections. Although the electoral process was flawed and the election was delayed by several weeks, the Electoral Commission managed to carry out an election with results that were acceptable to both the government and opposition groups. In late 2013, the new legislative assembly was seated without incident. President Conde wasted no time in announcing Guinea [re]opened for business and encouraging mining sector and other international investment. The country has come a long way since the assassination attempt and subsequent medical evacuation of former President Captain Moussa Dadis Camara in 2009.",
      "Guinea remains a country with a fragile government and a tenuous relationship with its citizens. Poor infrastructure and lack of basic utilities has led to occasional protests and the associated disruptions to traffic and commerce. There was an increase in the number and frequency of protests aimed at improving, or drawing attention to, this lack of basic services in 2014. In addition to an increase in protests against the country’s failing infrastructure, Guinea’s forest region also experienced local turmoil brought on by labor disputes between local communities and the mining companies, and among local tribal interests",

      "Less than one-third of Iceland’s total road network is paved, and many roads outside the capital, especially those that run through the center of the country, are impassable in winter. Many bridges are only one-lane wide (marked with a sign “Einbreid bru”) so drivers must be alert to oncoming traffic. Extreme care should be taken when driving in rural areas during the winter (October through April), when daylight hours are limited and the weather and road conditions can change rapidly. Many routes in the interior of the country are impassable until July due to muddy conditions and swollen rivers caused by snowmelt. Always inform someone of your travel plans.",

      "Icelandic law requires drivers to keep headlights on at all times. Talking on cell phones while driving is prohibited , except when using a hands-free system, and is subject to a fine of 5000 Icelandic Kronur (approximately $45). Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit is 50 km/h in urban areas and 30 km/h in residential areas. In rural areas, the speed limit depends on the type of road: on dirt and gravel roads, the speed limit is 80 km/h; on paved highways, the speed limit is 90 km/h. It is illegal to turn right on a red light. At four-way intersections, the right of way goes to the driver on the right; in traffic circles, drivers in the inside lane have the right of way. The use of seatbelts is mandatory in both the front and rear seats, and children under the age of six must be secured in a special car seat designed for their size and weight. Drivers are held responsible for any passenger under the age of 15 not wearing a seatbelt. No one shorter than 140 centimeters, lighter than 40 kilograms (or 88 pounds), or younger than 12 years of age is allowed to ride in a front seat equipped with an airbag. Driving under the influence of alcohol is considered a serious offense in Iceland. The threshold blood alcohol test (BAT) level is very low. Drivers can be charged with DUI (Driving Under the Influence) with a BAT as low as .05 percent.",

      "Traffic Safety and Road Conditions: Road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States. Traffic in Indonesia is dangerous, congested, and undisciplined. Traffic signals are frequently ignored and often in disrepair. The number and variety of vehicles on the road far exceed the capacity of existing roadways. Throughout the country, motor vehicles share the roads with other forms of transportation such as pedicabs, horse and ox carts, pushcarts, and livestock. Road conditions vary from good (in the case of toll roads and major city roads) to dangerously poor.",
      "Generally, road safety awareness is very low in Indonesia. Buses and trucks are often dangerously overloaded and travel at high speeds, frequently resulting in accidents. Most roads outside major urban areas have a single lane of traffic in each direction, making passing dangerous. Most Indonesian drivers do not maintain a safe following distance and tend to pass or maneuver with considerably less margin for error than do drivers in the United States. Although traffic in Indonesia moves on the left side of the road, drivers tend to pass on both sides and might use the shoulder for this purpose. It is common for drivers to create extra lanes regardless of the lane markings.",
      "Motorcycles often claim the right of way, weaving in and out of traffic with disregard for traffic regulations and simple safety precautions. Laws requiring all motorcycle passengers to wear helmets are inconsistently enforced, and passengers often do not wear helmets. Accidents on rented motorcycles constitute the largest cause of non-natural deaths and serious injury among foreigners living in and traveling to Indonesia. Accidents between a car and a motorcycle are invariably viewed as the fault of the driver of the car. Groups of motorcycle riders will sometimes threaten the driver of a car involved in an accident, regardless of who is at fault.",
      "Indonesia requires the use of seat belts in front seats; most Indonesian automobiles do not have seat belts in the rear passenger seats. The use of infant and child car seats is uncommon, and it can be very difficult to rent a car seat.",
      "Expatriates and affluent Indonesians often use professional drivers. All car rental firms provide drivers for a nominal additional fee. Travelers unfamiliar with Indonesian driving conditions are strongly encouraged to consider hiring drivers from reputable companies and through good recommendations. If you need to drive, drive defensively and use a seatbelt. Given the poor quality of emergency services, an injury considered to be minor in the United States might result in greater bodily harm in Indonesia.",
      "Driving at night can be extremely dangerous outside of major urban areas. Drivers often refuse to use their lights until it is completely dark, and most rural roads are unlit. Residents in rural areas sometimes use road surfaces as public gathering areas, congregating on them after dark.",
      "When an accident results in personal injury, Indonesian law requires both drivers to await the arrival of a police officer to report the accident. Although Indonesian law requires third-party insurance, most Indonesian drivers are uninsured; even when a vehicle is insured, it is common for insurance companies to refuse to pay damages. Nevertheless, if you plan to drive in Indonesia, ensure you have appropriate insurance coverage and a valid international driver's license. Ambulance service in Indonesia is unreliable, and taxis or private cars are often used to transport the injured to a medical facility. In cases of serious injury to a pedestrian, the driver of the vehicle could be required to help transport the injured person to the hospital. When an accident occurs outside a major city, it may be advisable, before stopping, to drive to the nearest police station to seek assistance.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit Indonesia's national tourist office online for road safety information.",
      "Transportation : New private airlines have begun operations over the past several years, as have new bus and ferry lines. Air, ferry, and road accidents that result in fatalities, injuries, and significant damage are common. While all forms of transportation are regulated in Indonesia, oversight is spotty, maintenance may not be properly performed, and rescue and emergency capacity is limited. Indonesia has experienced several fatal plane crashes and non-fatal runway overruns since 2011. Additionally, several ferry accidents and a train collision resulted in dozens of fatalities and even more injuries because of over-crowding and unsafe conditions.",
      "Aviation Safety and Oversight : Aviation Safety Oversight: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Indonesia’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Indonesia’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the FAA safety assessment page .",
      "Since 2014, a number of private pilots have inadvertently crossed into Indonesian airspace and have been detained and paid heavy fines. If you intend to fly on private aircraft through Indonesian airspace, including non-scheduled overflights, you should ensure that correct clearances have been obtained from Indonesian aviation authorities before your depart. Possible penalties include fines and imprisonment.",
      "Maritime Safety and Security: Inter-island travel by boat or ferry can be dangerous: storms can appear quickly, vessels can be crowded, and safety standards vary between providers. Ferries are frequently overcrowded and lack basic safety equipment; a number of ferries have sunk, resulting in loss of life. In 2014, the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency recorded 137 boat accidents (of which 16 were in Bali and Lombok), resulting in injuries and deaths. Make sure you are satisfied with safety standards before travelling, including safety equipment and life jackets. Do not board before confirming that adequate personal flotation devices are provided. Life jackets suitable for children aren’t always available and you should consider bringing your own.",
      "Piracy : Maritime piracy and other related crimes in and around Indonesian waters continue, although incidents have decreased steadily in recent years. Recent reports include thefts of valuables or cargo from boats that are in port and out at sea. Before traveling by sea, especially in the Straits of Malacca between Riau Province and Singapore, and in the waters north of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, review the current security situation with local authorities. Be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board, and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities."

      "Medical Facilities: The general level of sanitation and health care in Indonesia is far below U.S. standards. Some routine medical care is available in all major cities, although most expatriates leave the country for all but basic medical procedures. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited throughout Indonesia. Medical procedures requiring hospitalization or medical evacuation to locations with acceptable medical care, such as Singapore, Australia, or the United States can cost thousands of dollars. Physicians and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment or sizable deposits before providing medical care. A non-exhaustive list of English-speaking doctors and hospitals is accessible via the U.S. Embassy Jakarta's website.",
      "Ambulances: There is no reliable emergency ambulance service in Indonesia. Ambulance services are individually run by hospitals and clinics, and Indonesian ambulance attendants lack paramedical training equivalent to U.S. standards. If you are staying in Indonesia for an extended period, especially if you have known health problems, you should investigate private ambulance services in your area and provide family and close contacts with the direct telephone numbers of your preferred service. Traffic congestion is a significant problem in urban Indonesia and roads are generally in poor condition in rural Indonesia; ambulance transport, if it exists at all, can take hours, even over short distances.",
      "Sanitation and Public Health : Community sanitation and public health programs are inadequate. Water and air pollution and traffic congestion have increased with the unstructured growth of major cities. Almost all maladies of the developing world are endemic to Indonesia, and immediate treatment is problematic. Residents are subject to water- and food-borne illnesses such as typhoid, hepatitis, cholera, worms, amebiasis, giardia, cyclospora, and bacterial dysentery.",
      "Food and Water : Tap water is not potable. In 2008, Indonesian authorities found that 100 percent of tap water samples from the Jakarta area tested positive for coliform bacteria, as well as high concentrations of toxic chemicals, including lead and mercury. Bottled water should be used for consumption, including for cooking. Factory-bottled soft drinks, juices, and milk sold in sealed containers are generally considered safe. Take extra care when preparing fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. If you cannot see refrigerators, expect that any food, especially street food, is preserved with high concentrations of formaldehyde derivatives. Unprocessed or raw food may be unsafe even in higher-end establishments. Washing, soaking, peeling, and/or thoroughly cooking food are mandatory procedures to minimize insecticide, bacterial, and parasitic contamination. Gastrointestinal disorders are common in Indonesia.",
      "Prescriptions : Carry prescription medications in their original, marked container along with a copy of your prescription and keep them in your hand luggage while travelling. Local pharmacies carry a range of products of variable quality, availability, and cost. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a significant risk; patronize only reputable pharmacies.",
      "Availability of Blood : Rh negative blood may be difficult to obtain in an area with very few Westerners. Know your blood type and recognize that certain blood types may be scarce in Indonesia.",
      "Tuberculosis and Other Medical Conditions: Consult with your personal physicians and check the CDC website for information on prevalent diseases before traveling to Indonesia. You should be current on all recommended immunizations.",

Influenza vaccination may be helpful to reduce susceptibility to seasonal flu (H2N3). Live-bird markets are high risk areas for highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). Current information about influenza in Indonesia can be found on Flu Net .",
      "Dengue is caused by several species of mosquitoes that bite during the day. It exists throughout Indonesia, which has the highest incidence of dengue fever in Asia. Multiple drug-resistant strains of malaria are endemic in some parts of Indonesia, but not in metropolitan Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya, and Bali. Take precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes, including using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves, and sleeping under a permethrin-soaked bed net. Malaria prophylaxis is highly recommended for travel to malaria-endemic areas outside major cities. Travelers in Sulawesi should be tested for schistosomiasis.",
      "Rabies is endemic in Indonesia, but extensive dog vaccination has reduced cases in Bali by almost 80 percent. Other islands in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) and Sumatra still pose risks for rabies. Rabies is a highly fatal disease and availability of treatment is very limited. If bitten, immediately seek treatment at an international clinic. The CDC recommends rabies vaccination if you will spend time in rural areas while in Indonesia.",
      "Zika Virus: Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness, typically transmitted by the day biting Aedes aegypti mosquito, that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact and blood transfusion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other neurological conditions. For general information and the latest updates about Zika and steps to prevent mosquito bites and sexual exposure to the virus, please visit the CDC website .",

If you violate Indonesian laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. The Indonesian legal process is slow, and cases can take months to be resolved. Suspects can be held without charges for up to 60 days, and in some cases longer, during pre-trial investigation.",
      "In Indonesia, you may be detained for questioning if you don't have your passport with you. It is also illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, and driving under the influence of alcohol could land you immediately in jail. If you break local laws, your U.S. passport won't help you avoid arrest or prosecution. Certain areas of Indonesia are under Sharia law; see the section under Special Circumstances.",
      "In March 2008, the Indonesian parliament passed a bill criminalizing accessing internet sites containing violent or pornographic material. If you are found guilty of this offense, you could be jailed for up to three years or could have to pay a heavy fine.",
      "Indonesia’s child protection law imposes up to 15 years imprisonment for those convicted of engaging in sexual contact with a child under age 17. Indonesia’s anti-trafficking in persons law imposes 15 years imprisonment for anyone engaging in sex with a victim of trafficking.",
      "Penalties for possession of, use of, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Indonesia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. A life sentence or the death penalty can be imposed in cases of drug trafficking. Several foreigners have been sentenced to death in recent years. In 2011 a U.S. citizen received a death sentence for drug trafficking. Local authorities might perceive prescription drugs as illegal narcotics, so carry prescription medication and documentation with them in original marked containers to avoid confusion. Indonesian prisons are harsh and do not meet Western standards. Many prisoners must supplement their prison diets and clothing with funds from relatives. Medical and dental care in Indonesian prisons are below Western standards; access to medical testing to diagnose illness, as well as medications to treat conditions, are often difficult to obtain.",
      "There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",
      "Real or even perceived offense may draw a strong, negative response from local people. On one occasion, two U.S. citizens in western Sumatra were beaten after they reportedly accused a local man of theft. Another U.S. citizen in Sumatra was threatened by members of a local mosque after complaining about being awakened by the mosque’s morning call to prayer. Another U.S. citizen was beaten by a crowd when he pulled a plug on a speaker in a mosque.",
      "Arrest notifications in host country: While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested, that might not always be the case in Indonesia. To ensure that the U.S. government is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained. An Embassy consular officer will visit you at the earliest possible opportunity. To reach the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, dial (62) (021)-3435-9000 ext. 0 for the operator and ask for the duty officer.",
      "Special Circumstances : The U.S. Embassy security office restricts travel to certain areas of Indonesia by U.S. government personnel. These areas are subject to change. Currently, U.S. government travelers must receive prior authorization to travel to Papua and Central Sulawesi. Separate pre-travel procedures apply to U.S. Armed Forces personnel who intend to travel to Indonesia for any reason. For further information, please see the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide .",
      "Sharia Law: Sharia law is enforced in Aceh, a semi-autonomous province in the far north of Sumatra, by a separate police force. Authorities in Aceh have stated that Sharia law in Aceh is intended only for Muslims and does not apply to non-Muslims or foreign visitors. Under Aceh’s current Sharia code, offenses including homosexuality, gambling, consumption of alcohol, and proximity to the opposite sex outside of marriage are punishable with caning, fines, and imprisonment. Although head-covering covering is not compulsory, many women -- both Muslim and non-Muslim -- carry a scarf to drape around their heads while traveling in Aceh. Sharia law also exists unofficially or through local legislation in other areas. In these areas, implementation is uneven, processes are opaque, and enforcement can be arbitrary. Even though Sharia law does not apply to non-Muslims, you should be respectful of local tradition, dress modestly, and seek guidance from local police if confronted by Sharia authorities.",
      "Natural Disasters: Parts of Indonesia frequently experience earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. In addition, seasonal flooding from monsoons occurs regularly.",
      "Earthquakes and Tsunamis: Minor, and sometimes major, earthquakes occur every week throughout the archipelago -- there are approximately 4,000 earthquakes per year, with approximately 70-100 of them over 5.5 on the Richter scale. Sometimes these earthquakes can trigger tsunamis. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami killed an estimated 167,000 people in Indonesia. An October 2010 tsunami in the Mentawai islands killed more than 450 local residents and displaced tens of thousands of persons for several weeks. Tsunami warning systems may not be operable or reports of tremors and tsunamis may be delayed. In places where tsunamis are a potential threat, you should head inland for high ground immediately when large tremors are felt. Be sure to establish an escape route beforehand. The city of Jakarta lacks an earthquake plan, as does much of the country. Due to Indonesia’s large geographic expanse and poor infrastructure, disasters in isolated areas can result in delays in the arrival of emergency relief supplies.",
      "Volcanoes: There are 127 active volcanoes in Indonesia. Eruptions frequently cause travel delays, displace local populations and disrupt economic activities. Mount Sinabung, in the Tanah Karo Highlands of North Sumatra, has been erupting regularly since September 2013, causing the evacuation of approximately 30,000 people. Mount Raung, in East Java, became active in June 2015 and has forced occasional, multi-day closures of Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali (and nearby airports on other islands). On Java, Mount Merapi erupted most recently in 2010, caused 386 casualties and displaced 300,000 people. Indonesia’s volcano monitoring system enables the government to inform the population about potential eruptions and to direct evacuations so as to prevent casualties, but no system has been able to predict the timing or severity of all eruptions.",
      "Flooding and Landslides: During the December-March rainy season, floods and mudslides wreak havoc in many areas of Indonesia, including Jakarta. In January 2013, heavy rains caused substantial flooding in Jakarta. Landslides frequently follow heavy rains, and travelers should exercise caution both in and outside of cities. On the roads, be aware of the possibility of land slippage, road washouts, and potholes.",
      "Fires: Fire departments lack modern equipment and training. Seventy percent of Jakarta's fire hydrants are inoperative, and the city fire department is manned at only fifty percent of its recommended level. Outside of Jakarta, responding to fire-related emergencies can be even more challenging. Occupants in the upper levels of buildings and persons in crowded markets are at greatest risk, since fire departments typically are unable to reach those areas.",
      "Environmental Quality: Outside of Jakarta and other major cities, air quality is acceptable most of the time. Within Indonesia's major cities, however, air quality can range from &quot;unhealthy for sensitive groups&quot; to &quot;unhealthy.&quot; The air and water in Jakarta are particularly polluted. Some expatriate residents of Jakarta have tested positive for highly elevated levels of carbon monoxide in their blood. Individuals susceptible to chronic respiratory illnesses should consult with their doctor before spending significant amounts of time in Jakarta. Smoke from annual fires in forested and peat lands can create unhealthy air conditions in parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan, can cause substantial airport delays, and severely reduces visibility at various times of the year. Visitors should monitor local air quality and take appropriate precautions. Public water supplies are not potable.

Sewage and drainage systems are insufficient to adequately treat waste water and raw sewage.",
      "Scuba Diving, Snorkeling, and Surfing: Exercise prudence when scuba diving, snorkeling, or surfing, and when visiting remote tourist locations. Strong seasonal undercurrents in coastal waters can pose a fatal threat to surfers and swimmers; every year, several U.S. citizens drown. Local fishermen in coastal waters may use explosives and poisons to catch fish, even though this practice is illegal. Rescue services are mostly ad hoc and cannot be relied upon. Dangerous marine life, such as cnidaria (jellyfish) and physalia (Portuguese Man-O-War), are common. Divers and swimmers should be prepared to administer first aid to themselves and others in their party. Divers should contact the Divers Alert Network (DAN) to obtain diving medical insurance in the event decompression is required, since air evacuation may be the only way to get to the nearest decompression chamber. DAN has a large network of dive physicians who are available for consultation and emergency response to its members.",
      "Papua and Central Sulawesi: All travelers to Papua and West Papua provinces (including Raja Ampat) and Poso in Central Sulawesi province must obtain a travel permit (surat jalan) from the Indonesian government. The process for obtaining a surat jalan is governed by the police department in the area where the travel will occur and is subject to frequent change. Foreign tourists often use local travel agents to obtain travel permits to locations throughout Papua and West Papua provinces. Low-intensity communal conflict in Papua has caused numerous deaths and injuries. Travelers should strictly avoid situations involving armed tribal members or riots and demonstrations. There have been numerous deaths and injuries during anti-government protests and during actions by the Indonesian security forces against suspected separatists. In the area between Timika and the Grasberg copper and gold mine, there were more than 30 shooting incidents between 2009 and 2014 carried out by unknown gunmen targeting security personnel, employees, and contractors of a U.S. multi-national mining company.",
      "Mountain Hiking: If you are planning hikes or other outdoor activities in Indonesia, obtain up-to-date information on local conditions, travel with a reputable local guide, have overseas medical insurance, and carry a local mobile phone. Obey instructions from security and emergency personnel, and do not enter restricted areas. Organized and trained rescue services are rudimentary in populated areas and do not exist in many remote areas. Hikers on Puncak Jaya or other mountains should organize their trip through a reputable tour operator and ensure that they have firm, realistic primary and backup plans for climbing down the mountain, including evacuation insurance. In the past, some local tour operators have abandoned climbers after they reached the summit, after trips lasted longer than expected, or after disputes emerged about the fees charged by the tour guides. Transiting private or commercial properties on the way down the mountain is considered trespassing and is not a safe or legal alternative to a proper plan. Severe seismic events occur frequently and without notice. Hikers should assume that they will be completely on their own in case of any emergency.",

Many U.S. citizens have been unable to depart Indonesia because their employers would not release their passports after they had terminated their employment contracts early.",
      "Commercial Disputes: If you are involved in a commercial or property dispute, be aware that the business environment is complex. Formal, regulated, transparent dispute settlement mechanisms are not fully developed. Local and foreign businesses often cite corruption and ineffective courts as serious problems. Business and regulatory disputes, which would be generally considered administrative or civil matters in the United States, may in some cases be treated as criminal cases in Indonesia. In some instances, employees of U.S. companies in Indonesia have been subject to criminal penalties, including incarceration, as a result of judicial rulings stemming from commercial disputes. If you or your company become involved in a civil business dispute in Indonesia, Indonesian authorities may, without advance notice, prohibit you from leaving the country until the matter is resolved. Although you may be able to appeal the travel ban on humanitarian grounds, there is no guarantee that the appeal will be granted. There have been cases where Indonesian authorities have prevented U.S. citizens from leaving Indonesia for weeks or months.

If you are in Jakarta, Medan, or Surabaya, hire a taxi either at a major hotel or shopping center queue or call a reputable taxi company to arrange for transportation. At airports, use a reputable taxi service or a car arranged in advance. There have been reports of taxis painted to look like reputable companies being used to rob travelers. These crimes often involve “express” kidnappings, where armed criminals take passengers to a remote area to rob them. Criminals may also drive victims to ATM machines and force them to withdraw cash. Avoid using public transportation such as buses and trains; pick-pocketing is common in the crowded mass transit system.",

      "Credit Card and ATM Fraud : Credit card fraud and theft is a serious and growing problem in Indonesia. Travelers should use cash if possible and minimize the use of credit cards. Safeguard credit and ATM card numbers at all times. Avoid using credit cards for online transactions at Internet cafes and similar public venues. Monitor your credit card activity and immediately report any unauthorized use to your financial institution. Criminals have “skimmed” and “cloned” ATM cards, then used the stolen account information to drain bank accounts. If you use an ATM, choose one located in a secure location, such as a bank, and check the machine for evidence of tampering. Be cautious when using unfamiliar ATM machines, and monitor your account statements closely.",

There have been several reports of foreign tourists and Indonesians suffering methanol poisoning from adulterated liquor or cocktails, including a local liquor called arak/arrack, most recently in Bali and Lombok. This has led to serious illness and, in some cases, death. If you or someone you are traveling with exhibits signs of methanol poisoning, seek immediate medical attention. There have been many reports of men targeted by drink-spiking incidents in clubs and nightspots. One drug used in these incidents is believed to be an extremely powerful animal tranquilizer. Besides making the victim unconscious for a long time, these drugs can cause memory loss, nausea, headaches, and vomiting. Women also have been victimized in the past with “date rape” drugs. Local, &quot;home brew&quot; alcoholic drinks may also be spiked.",

It is often more effective to go in person to request help from Indonesian authorities rather than wait for emergency services to respond to your phone call.

You can extend a Visa-on-Arrival once for a maximum of 30 days by applying at an immigration office in Indonesia. The cost to extend a Visa-on-Arrival is $35. Visa-on-Arrival is not available to government travelers who want to enter Indonesia on a diplomatic or official passport for an official purpose. Visa in advance : Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia .

You should exercise extreme caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas, and try to use only cars that have seatbelts. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) and in taxis’ back seats. Helmets should always be worn on motorcycles and bicycles.",
      "Travel at night is particularly hazardous. Buses, patronized by hundreds of millions of Indians, are convenient in that they serve almost every city of any size. However, they are usually driven fast, recklessly, and without consideration for the rules of the road. Accidents are quite common. In order to drive in India, you must have either a valid Indian driver’s license or a valid international driver’s license. Because of difficult road and traffic conditions, you may wish to consider hiring a local driver.",
      "On Indian roads, the safest driving policy is always to assume that other drivers will not respond to a traffic situation in the same way you would in the United States. Buses and trucks often run red lights and merge directly into traffic at yield points and traffic circles. Cars, autos, bicycles, and pedestrians behave only slightly more cautiously. Use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence. It is both customary and wise.",

On the few divided highways one can expect to meet local transportation traveling in the wrong direction, often without lights. Heavy traffic is the norm and includes (but is not limited to) overloaded trucks and buses, scooters, pedestrians, bullock and camel carts, horse or elephant riders en route to weddings, bicycles, and free-roaming livestock. Traffic in India moves on the left. It is important to be alert while crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark as traffic is coming in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction. Travelers should remember to use seatbelts in both rear and front seats where available, and to ask their drivers to maintain a safe speed.",

Such attacks pose significant risk of injury or death to the vehicle's occupants or risk of incineration of the vehicle.

There are concerns that the interests and rights of commissioning parents, surrogates, egg donors, and the resulting children may not always be adequately protected. There is also potential for grave errors to be made. Between 2011 and 2014, DNA tests determined five U.S. citizens had no genetic relationship with the baby they commissioned by surrogacy.",
      "For a child born of surrogacy to acquire U.S. citizenship and obtain a U.S. passport, the parents must submit evidence showing a genetic relationship between the newborn child and a U.S.-citizen parent. This is best accomplished through DNA testing. Alternately, the parents can submit evidence showing that a U.S. citizen woman was the gestational and legal mother of the child at the time and place of the child’s birth. (A gestational mother is the woman who carries and gives birth to the child.) This is best accomplished through prenatal records. Newborns found not to have acquired U.S. citizenship at birth risk being stateless persons unable to obtain travel documents as Indian law prohibits the issuance of Indian passports to children born of surrogacy. With no right to other citizenship, infants may be stranded in India. No laws govern the commercial surrogacy industry in India.",

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in another country, you are subject to its laws even though you are a U.S. citizen. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own. In some places, you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you. In some places, it is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. In addition, in some places driving under the influence of alcohol could land you immediately in jail. These criminal penalties will vary from country to country. If you do something illegal in your host country, your U.S. passport will not provide you any additional courtesies. It is very important to know what is legal and what is not where you are going. It is also important to note that there are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. For example, you can be prosecuted in the United States if you buy pirated goods, engage in sexual conduct with children, or use or disseminate child pornography in a foreign country even if those activities are not illegal in that country.",
      "Each of India’s states has independent regulations concerning alcohol purchase and consumption. Legal drinking ages range from 18 to 25 and can vary by beverage type. Some states permit alcohol use for medicinal purposes only, others require you to hold a permit to buy, transport, or consume alcohol. Penalties for violation can be harsh, so travelers are advised to check with Indian authorities in the states they plan to visit.",
      "While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested, local Indian authorities do not always do so. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas.",

All claimed that they did not realize they were carrying narcotics. Never transport or mail packages that do not belong to you and maintain direct control of your luggage at all times.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:",
      "Dual nationality: India does not permit its citizens to hold dual nationality. In 2006, India launched the &quot;Overseas Citizens of India&quot; (OCI) program, which has often been mischaracterized as a dual nationality program. It does not grant Indian citizenship. If you are a U.S. citizen and obtain an OCI card you will not become a citizen of India; you will remain a citizen of the United States. An OCI card is similar to a U.S. &quot;green card&quot; in that a holder can travel to and from India indefinitely, work in India, study in India, and own property in India (except for certain agricultural and plantation properties). An OCI card holder, however, does not receive an Indian passport, cannot vote in Indian elections, and is not eligible for Indian government employment. The OCI program is similar to the Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) card introduced by the Indian government several years ago, except that PIO holders must still register with Indian immigration authorities, and PIO cards are not issued for an indefinite period. U.S. citizens of Indian descent can apply for PIO or OCI cards at the Indian Embassy in Washington, or at the Indian Consulates in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Houston. Inside India, U.S. citizens can apply at the nearest FRRO office (please see “Entry/Exit Requirements” section above for more information on the FRRO). U.S. citizens are required to travel on a U.S. passport when traveling in and out of the United States.",
      "Religious activities: If you plan to engage in religious proselytizing, you are required by Indian law to have a &quot;missionary&quot; visa. Immigration authorities have determined that certain activities, including speaking at religious meetings to which the general public is invited, may violate immigration law if the traveler does not hold a missionary visa. Foreigners with tourist visas who engage in missionary activity are subject to deportation and possible criminal prosecution. The states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh have active “anti-conversion” legislation regulating conversion from one religious faith to another. Arunachal Pradesh currently has an inactive “anti-conversion” law awaiting accompanying regulations needed for enforcement. If you intend to engage in missionary activity, you may wish to seek legal advice to determine whether the activities you intend to pursue are permitted under Indian law.",
      "Tourists should also be mindful of restrictions and observances when planning to visit any religious establishment, whether Hindu temples, mosques, churches, or other locations considered sacred by the local population. Many individual temples and mosques do not permit non-members to enter all or parts of the facilities, and may require the removal of shoes, the covering of the head, or have other specific requirements for appropriate attire.",
      "Customs restrictions: Before traveling to or from India, you are urged to inspect all bags and clothing thoroughly that might inadvertently contain prohibited items. Since January 2010, several U.S. citizens have been arrested or detained when airport security officials discovered loose ammunition (even spent individual bullets and casings) and weapons in their luggage. If you are found to have loose ammunition or bullets (including empty bullet shells used in souvenirs) on your person or in your bags, you could be charged with violation of the Indian Arms Act, incarcerated, and/or deported from India. In addition to firearms and ammunition, Indian customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from India of such items as, antiquities, electronic equipment, currency, ivory, gold objects, and other prohibited materials. In particular, possession of satellite phones is prohibited in India and may result in arrest and prosecution. Permission from the Government of India is required to bring in restricted items, even if you are only transiting through India. If you do not comply with these regulations, you risk arrest or fine or both and confiscation of these items. If you are charged with any alleged legal violations by Indian law enforcement, have an attorney review any document before you sign it. The Government of India requires the registration of antique items with the local police along with a photograph of the item. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of India in Washington or one of India's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.

      "Past attacks have targeted public places, including some frequented by Westerners, such as luxury and other hotels, trains, train stations, markets, cinemas, mosques, and restaurants in large urban areas. Attacks have taken place during the busy evening hours in markets and other crowded places, but could occur at any time. Recent incidents include a series of bomb blasts at an election rally in Patna , Bihar that killed six and injured 85 others in October 2013; a series of explosions at the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya on July 7, 2013 that caused damage to the temple complex; an explosion on April 17, 2013 in Bangalore in which sixteen people were reported to have been injured; and twin bombings near a bus stop and commercial area in Hyderabad on February 21, 2013, that killed 17 and injured 119 bystanders. The Maoists (also known as “Naxalites”) are the most active insurgent group in India. The Naxalites typically attack Indian government officials, but have also derailed trains, targeted other government buildings such as police stations, and kidnapped foreigners. They operate mostly in the more remote areas of the country.",
      "Beyond the threat from terrorism and insurgencies, demonstrations and general strikes, or “bandh,” often cause major inconvenience and unrest. These strikes can result in the stoppage of all transportation and tourist-related services, at times for 24 hours or more. U.S. citizens caught in such a strike may find they are unable to make flight and rail connections, as local transportation can be severely limited. Local media generally give an idea of the length and geographical location of the strike. Large religious gatherings that attract hundreds of thousands of people can result in dangerous and often life-threatening stampedes. Local demonstrations can begin spontaneously and escalate with little warning, disrupting transportation systems and city services and posing risks to travelers. In response to such events, Indian authorities occasionally impose curfews and/or restrict travel. You are urged to obey such curfews and travel restrictions and to avoid demonstrations and rallies as they have the potential for violence, especially immediately preceding and following political rallies, elections, and religious festivals (particularly when Hindu and Muslim festivals coincide). Tensions between castes and religious groups can also result in disruptions and violence. In some cases, demonstrators specifically block roads near popular tourist sites and disrupt train operations in order to gain the attention of Indian authorities; occasionally vehicles transporting tourists are attacked in these incidents. India generally goes on “High Alert” status prior to major holidays or events. You should monitor local television, print media, Mission India’s American Citizens Services Facebook page, and enroll with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program for further information about the current situation in areas where you will travel.",

A number of terrorist groups operate in the state, targeting security forces in the region, particularly along the Line of Control (LOC) separating Indian and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, and those stationed in primary tourist destinations in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. Since 1989, as many as 70,000 people (terrorists, security forces, and civilians) have been killed in the Kashmir conflict. Foreigners are particularly visible, vulnerable, and at risk.

The Naxalites have a long history of conflict with state and national authorities, including frequent terrorist attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials, and are responsible for more attacks in the country than any other organization through an ongoing campaign of violence and intimidation. In May 2013, the Naxalites ambushed a convoy of political leaders in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh and killed 28 people, including the President of the state Congress Party and the founder of a government paramilitary group. In March 2012 Naxalite guerrillas abducted four persons including two Italian nationals from a remote area of southern Odisha. In February 2012, four officers of the Border Security Force (BSF) were killed in an ambush by Communist Party of India-Maoist rebels in the Malkangiri district of Odisha. Naxalites have not specifically targeted U.S. citizens but have attacked symbolic targets that have included Western companies and rail lines. While Naxalite violence does not normally occur in places frequented by foreigners, there is a risk that visitors could become victims of violence.",

The campus of Osmania University in Hyderabad has been the site of recurring civil disturbances regarding the Telangana statehood issue as well as throughout the remaining districts now comprising Andhra Pradesh. State bifurcation-related strikes and protests have occurred, lasted for lengthy periods, sporadically shut down transportation, disrupted municipal services, and resulted in police-ordered curfews. Within Hyderabad, organized demonstrations are often held at Indira Park, located on Lower Tank Bund Road, and adjacent areas surrounding Hussain Sagar Lake. Other locations where protests have occurred include the State Legislative Assembly, Gun Park, and Nizam College in Bashir Bagh.

      "CRIME: Petty crime, especially theft of personal property (including U.S. passports), is common, particularly on trains or buses, at airports, and in major tourist areas. Pickpockets can be very adept and women have reported having their bags snatched, purse-straps cut, or the bottom of their purses slit without their knowledge. If you are traveling by train, lock your sleeping compartments and take your valuables with you when leaving your berth. If you travel by air, be careful with your bags in the arrival and departure areas outside airports. Violent crime, especially directed against foreigners, has traditionally been uncommon, although in recent years there has been a modest increase. Be cautious about displaying cash or expensive items to reduce the chance of being a target for robbery or other crime, and be aware of your surroundings when you use ATMs. ATM card scams have been used to clone credit card details to withdraw money. Gangs and criminal elements operate in major cities and have sometimes targeted unsuspecting business travelers and their family members for kidnapping or extortion.",
      "Sexual Assault: Travelers should be aware that there have been reported cases of sexual assault, including rape, of U.S. citizens traveling throughout India. U.S. citizens, particularly women, are cautioned not to travel alone in India. Women traveling in India are advised to respect local dress and customs. Customary everyday dress for Indian women throughout the country is conservative, and even more so in non-urban areas, with women wearing clothing that covers their legs and shoulders. Exceptions are vacation resorts catering to foreign clientele and some neighborhoods of the major cities of New Delhi and Mumbai. Western women, especially those of African descent, continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by individuals and groups of men. Known locally as “Eve-teasing,” these incidents of sexual harassment can be quite frightening and can quickly cross the line from verbal to physical. Sexual harassment can occur anytime or anywhere, but most frequently has happened in crowded areas such as in market places, train stations, buses, and public streets. The harassment can range from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to catcalls to outright groping. Following the December 2012 brutal gang-rape and subsequent death of a young Indian woman in New Delhi, the Government of India has focused greater attention on addressing issues of gender violence. One outcome has been greater reporting of incidences of sexual assault country-wide, and Indian authorities report rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. Among large cities, Delhi experienced the highest number of reported crimes against women. Although most victims have been local residents, recent sexual attacks against female visitors in tourist areas across India underline the fact that foreign women are at risk and should exercise vigilance.",
      "Women should observe stringent security precautions, including avoiding use of public transport after dark without the company of known and trustworthy companions, restricting evening entertainment to well-known venues, and avoiding isolated areas when alone at any time of day. Keep your hotel room number confidential and make sure hotel room doors have chains, deadlocks, and peep holes. When possible, travel around the area with groups of friends rather than alone. In addition, only hire reliable cars and drivers and avoid traveling alone in hired taxis, especially at night. Use taxis from hotels and pre-paid taxis at airports rather than hailing them on the street. If you encounter threatening situations, call “100” for police assistance (“112” from mobile phones).",
      "Scams: Major airports, train stations, popular restaurants, and tourist sites are often used by scam artists looking to prey on visitors, often by creating a distraction. Beware of taxi drivers and others, including train porters, who solicit travelers with &quot;come-on&quot; offers of cheap transportation and/or hotels. Travelers accepting such offers have frequently found themselves the victims of scams, including offers to assist with &quot;necessary&quot; transfers to the domestic airport, disproportionately expensive hotel rooms, unwanted &quot;tours,&quot; unwelcome &quot;purchases,&quot; extended cab rides, and even threats when the tourists decline to pay. There have been reports of tourists being lured, held hostage and extorted for money in the face of threats of violence against the traveler and his/her family members.",
      "You should exercise care when hiring transportation and/or guides and use only well-known travel agents to book trips. Some scam artists have lured travelers by displaying their name on a sign when they leave the airport. Another popular scam is to drop money or to squirt something on the clothing of an unsuspecting traveler and use the distraction to rob them of their valuables.

In fact, the U.S. citizen “friend” does not exist; they are only online personas used by criminal networks. Victims have been defrauded of thousands of dollars in these schemes.

Travelers in possession of International Driver’s Permits may drive in Iran, though the Foreign Interests Section in Iran does not recommend that tourists drive in Iran. Iran has a very high rate of traffic accidents, the second highest cause of mortality in the country. Drivers throughout Iran tend to ignore traffic lights, traffic signs, and lane markers. Urban streets are not well lit; it is therefore particularly dangerous to drive at night. Sidewalks in urban areas exist only on main roads and are usually obstructed by parked cars. In residential areas, few sidewalks exist. Drivers almost never yield to pedestrians at crosswalks. If you are involved in an accident, no matter how minor, do not leave the scene; wait until the police arrive to file a report.",

Terrorist explosions have killed a number of people in Iran in past years. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to areas within 100 kilometers of the border with Afghanistan, within 10 kilometers of the border with Iraq, and generally anywhere east of the line from Bam and Bandar Abbas toward the Pakistan border. U.S. citizens are advised to avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings. Increased tension between Iran and the West over the past several years is a cause of concern for U.S. citizen travelers. Large-scale demonstrations in response to politically motivated events have taken place sporadically throughout the country, resulting in a significant security presence, arrests, and occasional clashes between demonstrators and security officials. U.S. citizens should stay current with media coverage of local events and be aware of their surroundings at all times. U.S. passport holders who are arrested or detained by Iranian authorities should request assistance from the Foreign Interests Section at the Swiss Embassy in Tehran.

To obtain a visa, contact the Iranian Interests Section of the Embassy of Pakistan located at 2209 Wisconsin Ave. NW, Washington, DC. 20007; tel. 202-965-4990, 91, 92, 93, 94, 99; fax 202-965-1073, 202-965-4990 (Automated Fax-On-Demand after office hours); email: requests@daftar.org .",
      "U.S. citizens traveling to Iran are fingerprinted upon entry. The Iranian press has reported that foreign tourists may obtain tourist visas at the airport in Tehran, however U.S. citizens are not eligible to receive these visas and must obtain valid visas from the Iranian Interests Section at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, DC. Possession of a valid Iranian visa will not guarantee entry into the country.",
      "U.S. passports are valid for travel to Iran. However, the Iranian government does not recognize dual nationality and will treat U.S.-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens subject to Iranian laws. Thus, U.S. citizens who were born in Iran, who became naturalized citizens of Iran (e.g., through marriage to an Iranian citizen), and children of such persons—even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian—are considered Iranian nationals by Iranian authorities. Despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under Iranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport unless the Iranian government has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. Dual nationals may be subject to harsher legal treatment than visitors with only U.S. citizenship. (See section on Special Circumstances below.)",
      "Iranian authorities have prevented a number of U.S. citizen academics, scientists, journalists, and others who traveled to Iran from leaving the country and in some cases have detained, interrogated, and imprisoned them on unknown or various charges, including espionage and being a threat to the regime. U.S. citizens of Iranian origin should consider the risk of being targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. Iranian authorities routinely deny dual nationals access to the Foreign Interests Section of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran because they consider dual nationals to be solely Iranian citizens.",
      "As a precaution, it is advisable for U.S.-Iranian dual nationals to obtain, in their Iranian passports, the necessary visas for the countries they will transit upon their return to the United States so that if their U.S. passports are confiscated in Iran, they may depart Iran with their Iranian passport. These individuals can then apply for a new U.S. passport in the country they are transiting.",
      "No visa is required for Iranian nationals, including dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, traveling to Dominica, Ecuador, Haiti, Malaysia, Micronesia, Nicaragua, Tunisia, Turkey, and Venezuela.",
      "Dual nationals whose U.S. passports are confiscated may also obtain a “Confirmation of Nationality” from the Foriegn Interests Section of the Embassy of Switzerland, the U.S. protecting power. This statement enables the travelers to apply for third-country visas in Tehran, provided they meet Schengen States' criteria for a visa. Dual nationals finding themselves in this situation should note in advance that the Swiss Embassy would issue this statement only after the traveler's U.S. nationality is confirmed and after some processing delay. A &quot;Confirmation of Nationality&quot; would be considered in lieu of the standard invitation letter that all Schengen visa applicants are required to present; however, it does not guarantee issuance of an entry visa. Dual nationals must enter and depart the United States on U.S. passports.",
      "Visa extensions are time-consuming and must be filed at least one week in advance of the expiration date. A foreign national and anyone accompanying him/her will pay a fine of 300,000 rials (IRR) or 30,000 tomans per day for each day of unauthorized stay in Iran.",
      "U.S. citizens whose stay surpasses six months, and whose domicile is outside Iran, need to obtain an exit permit to leave the country. U.S. citizens residing in Iran on permanent resident visas must obtain an exit permit each time they depart Iran, regardless of the period of stay. Although an exit stamp is no longer inserted into the passport, the exit tax must still be paid. All holders of an Iranian passport are required to pay an exit tax (currently 750,000 IRR) regardless of the duration of their stay in Iran. More specific information on Iranian passport and exit visa requirements may be obtained from the Iranian Interests Section of the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, DC.",
      "Non-Iranian-national women who marry Iranian citizens gain Iranian nationality upon marriage. If the marriage takes place in Iran, the woman’s U.S. passport will be confiscated by Iranian authorities. A woman must have the consent of her husband to leave Iran or, in his absence, must gain the permission of the local prosecutor. Iranian law, combined with the lack of diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran, means that the Foreign Interests Section in Tehran can provide only very limited assistance if a U.S. citizen woman married to an Iranian man has marital difficulties and/or encounters difficulty in leaving Iran.",
      "After divorce or death of her husband, a foreign-born woman has the choice to renounce her Iranian citizenship, but any of the couple’s children will automatically be Iranian citizens and their citizenship is irrevocable. They will be required to enter and depart Iran on Iranian passports. For a divorce to be recognized it should be carried out in Iran or, if outside Iran, in accordance with Sharia law. Upon divorce, custody of the children normally goes to the mother until children reach age 7, at which point custody automatically transfers to the father. Even if the courts grant custody to the mother, she will need permission from the paternal grandfather or the courts to obtain exit visas for children under age 18 to leave the country. The term &quot;custody&quot; in the United States does not have the same legal meaning in Iran. In Iran a woman is granted &quot;guardianship,&quot; and only in very rare cases is actually granted &quot;custody.&quot; Even if the woman has &quot;custody/guardianship”, all legal decisions (e.g., application for a passport, permission to exit Iran, etc.) still require the consent of the father. Iran is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.",

      "Côte d'Ivoire’s road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning Côte d’Ivoire is provided for general reference only. Serious traffic accidents, one of the greatest threats to U.S. citizens in Côte d’Ivoire, occur regularly in Abidjan and throughout the country. Unsafe road conditions, unskilled drivers, and poorly maintained and overloaded vehicles create hazardous driving conditions. Speed limits, lane markings, and signals are not respected, and drivers do not yield for pedestrians or bicyclists. Drive defensively, watch out for public transportation vehicles that stop and start without warning, and be especially cautious at intersections because traffic lights often malfunction. If you drive at night, beware of vehicles without headlights or taillights, and pedestrians and bicycles along the roadside. In case of an accident, do not move your vehicle until a police officer tells you to do so. However, if there is no other vehicle to take the injured to a hospital, or if you believe your life is in danger from others at the site of the accident, go to the nearest hospital or police station.",
      "Abidjan has a poor public transportation system; if you choose to travel by bus despite the risks, the “Express” line is believed to be the safest and most reliable. In Abidjan, taxis are readily available and inexpensive (metered, but possibly rigged; you may be able to negotiate a better rate). They are, however, poorly maintained and notorious for not respecting the rules of the road. There have been reports of robberies in metered or orange taxis, though widely thought to be the most secure form of public transportation. Communal taxis (“woro-woros”), used only within the limits of each commune, are not metered and are dangerous. Do not use local vans (&quot;Gbaka&quot;) because they are frequently involved in accidents. Always travel in groups and avoid driving on roads outside of Abidjan at night.",

The Embassy recommends that motorists drive with doors locked and windows closed at all times. While stopped in traffic, allow enough room between your car and the one in front to maneuver out if needed. Before getting into your car, look around to see if there is anyone paying unusual attention and, if someone appears to be watching do not go to your vehicle, get assistance instead. If confronted, remain courteous and calm and, if threatened, do not resist. Please report any incident to the U.S. Embassy in Abidjan.",

Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them.

Armed carjackings, robberies of businesses, and home invasions occur, targeting residents, including expatriates, who are perceived as wealthy. U.S. citizens, either visiting or residing in Côte d’Ivoire, are strongly encouraged to remain alert and aware of their surroundings to avoid becoming a victim of crime. The general guidance for travel to Côte d’Ivoire is exercise the same prudence and caution that you would in any metropolitan area in the United States; refrain from conspicuous displays of wealth such as jewelry and other valuables, carry limited amounts of cash, and only photocopies of key documents. Always carry identification and be discreet about your transactions, especially on the street. Normal spending habits of Westerners may appear extravagant to Ivoirians, making U.S. citizens targets of crime. When moving about the city, stay in well-lit areas and walk confidently at a steady pace on the side of the street facing traffic close to the curb. Avoid crowds, mass transit, alleys, and sparsely populated areas. Take caution when walking past concealed areas such as doorways and bushes. Whenever possible, travel in pairs or small groups. If you go out at night and need transportation, orange taxis are an option as they are typically metered (although meters may be rigged). Be cognizant that there have been reports of muggings and robbery scams even in metered taxis. Home and car doors should be locked at all times.",

Popular neighborhoods for nighttime entertainment, such as Zone 4, Treichville, and Plateau, often attract crime. When traveling outside of Abidjan, avoid traveling after dark and be aware that rogue police, security forces, and criminals often use vehicular checkpoints to extort money from drivers and passengers. There have been few reported cases of sexual assault against foreigners, but there are no available statistics or other reliable reporting on this issue.",

      "Credit card use in Côte d’Ivoire is limited, particularly outside Abidjan, and credit card fraud is an increasing problem. Business fraud is common and the perpetrators often target foreigners. Schemes previously associated with Nigeria are now prevalent in Côte d’Ivoire, and pose a risk of significant financial loss. Typically these scams begin with unsolicited communication (usually by e-mail) from strangers who promise quick financial gain, often by transferring large sums of money or valuables out of the country, but then require a series of &quot;advance fees&quot; to be paid, such as fees for legal documents or taxes. A common variation is the scammer’s claim to be a refugee or émigré of a prominent West African family, who needs assistance transferring large sums of cash. Another common scam involves alleged victims of a serious accident or injury in need of money for life-saving medical care. Still other variations appear to be legitimate business deals that require advance payments on contracts or large purchases of merchandise using fraudulent credit cards. Sometimes victims are convinced to provide bank account and credit card information, and authorize financial transactions that drain their accounts, causing them to incur large debts.",
      "The best way to avoid becoming a victim of advance-fee fraud is common sense: if a proposition looks too good to be true, it probably is a scam, particularly if you have never met the correspondent. You should carefully check and research any unsolicited business proposal before committing funds, providing goods or services, or undertaking travel. A good clue to a scam is the phone number given to the victim; legitimate businesses and offices provide fixed line numbers, while scams typically use only cellular (cell) phones. In Côte d’Ivoire, most cell phone numbers start with 04, 05, 06, 44, 45, 46, 48, 58, 60, 66, or 67. Note that it is virtually impossible to recover money lost through these scams.

      "Under the direction of President Alassane Ouattara since his inauguration in May 2011, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire continues to move forward with a broad range of programs that have increased the country’s security and improved the economic climate. Over a decade of political unrest and violence began in 1999, culminating in the 2010-11 post-electoral crisis that was precipitated by former President Laurent Gbagbo’s refusal to accept the outcome of the 2010 election. Since the Ouattara administration assumed office, the country has largely returned to stability. The Government, however, continues to have limited capacity to provide basic services to the Ivoirian population, particularly those related to safety and security issues. Police and gendarmes are not always able to fulfill their public security mandates due to inadequate training and an acute lack of resources, such as weapons, transportation, and communications equipment. Despite numerous positive developments across virtually all sectors, anti-government elements continue to pose a threat. In addition, security concerns remain in the western region, and there were several cross-border attacks in communities along the Liberian border in 2014. In November and December 2014, factions of the Republican Forces of Côte d’Ivoire (FRCI) went on strike in protest of outstanding backpay. The situation returned to normal following negotiations with the Government. At the end of June 2015, the Government concluded its program to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate ex-combattants, and has taken other actions to eliminate militia operating outside the official security forces. Criminal activity, including armed robbery, remains a problem in the country.",

      "Road Conditions and Safety : Cars are driven on the left side of the road in Jamaica. Here are some notes for your safety:",
      "Night time driving is extremely hazardous due to poor lighting and unpredictable pavement. Heavy rains can make roads impassable and dangerous. Many roads suffer from ill repair, inadequate signage, large potholes and poor traffic markings. There is a lack of pedestrian crosswalks. Pedestrians and animals share the roadways with vehicles. There have been reports of carjackings, including of rental cars. Only two highways are comparable to U.S. standards, T1 which connects Spanish Town (near Kingston) to May Pen and Highway 2000 which connects Spanish Town to Mammee Bay. Driving habits range from aggressive speeding and sudden stops by taxis in the middle of the road to over-polite drivers who suddenly stop to allow a car to pull in front of them. All can lead to accidents. Official emergency response can be slow. In practice, assistance given in emergency situations is generally by fellow motorists.",
      "Traffic Laws:",
      "Traffic circles (“roundabouts”) are often poorly marked and require traffic to move in a clockwise direction. Motorists entering a roundabout must yield to those already in it. Drivers and front-seat passengers are required to wear seat belts. Motorcycle riders are required to wear helmets.",
      "Public Transportation : U.S. government personnel are prohibited from using public buses.",
      "Official public transportation vehicles have red license plates. Private vehicles, NOT licensed for public transportation, have white license plates with blue letters/numbers. Public buses are often overcrowded, and are frequently a venue for crime. There are reports of private buses, acting as public transport, driving erratically leading to injury and death for both riders and pedestrians. You should only use licensed taxicabs having red-and-white PP license plates or taxis recommended by your hotel. Do not accept rides from strangers.",
      "See our Road Safety page for more information. We also suggest that you visit the website of Jamaica’s national tourist office .",

Comprehensive but basic emergency medical services are located only in Kingston and Montego Bay, and smaller public hospitals are located in each parish.",
      "Prescription Drugs: The availability of prescription drugs is very limited in outlying parishes. Epi-Pens are not sold anywhere on the island.",
      "Ambulances and Emergency Care: Ambulance service is limited both in the provision of emergency care and in the availability of vehicles. Ambulance services in the cities can be slow due to traffic congestion and the general state of roads, and ambulance services are rare in rural areas.",
      "Public Health Facilities : Public health facilities do not meet United States standards. They are required by law to provide medical assistance in emergency situations, but specialized tests and treatment are offered only on a fee-for-service basis. Hospitals are not equipped to handle multiple patients with ventilators.",
      "Private Health Facilities : Private hospitals generally appear more modern than public facilities. They are also far more expensive and U.S. citizens have reported that they have been subject to the following practices:",
      "Payment is required up front for care, even in emergency situations, and patients have been turned away for lack of ability to pay. Without proof of acceptable insurance or cash sufficient to pay expected fees, a patient will be turned away from a private facility. Fees are often exorbitant. Health-care facilities near beach resorts in particular have been known to extend care only after collecting a sizeable cash deposit.",

      "Common reasons for arrest include:",
      "Drug smuggling. Carrying ammunition and firearms into Jamaica. (Even a single bullet inadvertently loose in a carry-on bag will lead to arrest.) Carrying mace, pepper spray and knives into Jamaica without authorization. Driving under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants. Possession of more than two ounces of marijuana or any quantity of other illicit drugs.",

      "Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance : While some of the country’s all-inclusive resorts meet U.S. standards, most transportation, entertainment, and even medical facility options are not designed to accommodate visitors who are physically challenged.

The Regional Security Office of the U.S. Embassy restricts travel by U.S. government personnel to certain urban areas of Jamaica, including but not limited to:",

      "Notes for your safety:",
      "Sudden demonstrations are rare but can occur, during which demonstrators often construct roadblocks or otherwise block streets. Nightclubs and other places of entertainment often are not compliant with U.S. fire safety regulations. Gated resorts are generally safe, but even within resorts visitors have been robbed inside their rooms while they slept. Sexual assaults occur with alarming frequency, including at all-inclusive resorts. (See further notes below.) Jamaica’s police force is understaffed and has limited resources. Tourist police are on duty in some resort towns and can be identified by their white hats, white shirts, and black trousers.",
      "Best Practices:",
      "Avoid inner-city areas of Kingston and other urban centers, especially after dark. Do not accept rides from unknown individuals, including operators of unmarked taxis, as this is often a pretext for attempted robbery and/or sexual assault. Avoid public buses. Avoid walking alone, and exercise special care after dark. If staying in a villa or small establishment, ask if they have met Jamaica Tourist Board certification standards for safety and security. See the State Department publication, “ traveling safely abroad ,” for additional useful advice on security while traveling.",
      "Sexual Assault: The U.S. Embassy received more than a dozen reports of sexual assaults against American visitors to Jamaica in a twelve-month period. Most of these took place at all-inclusive resorts; most were allegedly perpetrated by resort staff.",
      "Notes for your safety :",
      "Resort staff members are prohibited against fraternization and intimacy with guests. Any employee behavior contradicting this policy should be rebuffed and reported to hotel management and to the U.S. Embassy. There have been reports of use of date rape drugs at private parties and resorts. If you are victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the Embassy as soon as possible. In a hotel, management should assist you with these communications. While we have seen a recent effort by Jamaican officials to improve their response to sexual assault cases, sexual assault victims in Jamaica should not expect the totality of assistance routinely offered in the United States. Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Rape kits sometimes are not available. Hotel management and police may project a prosecutorial/interrogation position in questioning victims. Counseling is unlikely to be offered to victims. Victims often have to ask for medication to avoid transmission of STDs and to reduce the chances of pregnancy. Prosecution of a rape case moves forward very slowly, and defense attorneys press aggressively for dismissal. Jamaican law may require the victim to return to Jamaica at some stages of the judicial process. The government of Jamaica should finance such witness travel, but often such support is slow or unavailable.",
      "Best Practices:",
      "In a resort, avoid secluded places or situations. Try to always be accompanied by someone you know, even on visits to the rest room. Many guests drink to excess in all-inclusive resorts, sometimes leading to unpredictable behavior. Security outside of the resort area is unpredictable, especially at night. Do not leave resort property with someone you have just met. Shout for help immediately if you feel threatened or encounter individuals who make you feel uncomfortable. Report any suspicious activity, including excessive friendliness by hotel employees, to hotel management, the U.S. Embassy, and, as appropriate, local police.",
      "Drugs : Marijuana use is widespread in Jamaica. Recent legislation has made its possession a civil offense rather than a criminal one.",
      "While its use is widely tolerated, possession of two ounces or less of marijuana is still illegal, and may result in a fine (not an arrest). Possession of more than two ounces of marijuana or possession or use of any amount of other illicit drugs remains illegal in Jamaica and may lead to arrest and prosecution. Any attempt to carry marijuana out of the country may lead to a serious charge of drug trafficking.",
      "Financial Scams: Serious financial scams originate in Jamaica, often targeting U.S. citizens. The State Department and the FBI maintain webpages with details about the extent of the problem – connect to Department of State and the FBI pages for more information.",
      "The most notorious Jamaican scam is referred to as the “Lotto Scam,” sometimes called “Advance Fee Fraud.” The victim is led to believe that a Jamaican lottery prize will be released after payment of “fees.”",
      "Notes for your safety:",
      "You did NOT win a lottery that you do not recall having entered. The person on the telephone is lying. Just hang up. Never send money to someone who calls to inform you that you have won the lottery in Jamaica. Do not travel to Jamaica to “collect a prize.” Victims have been subjected to kidnapping, extortion, or robbery.",
      "Other scams :",
      "Be very cautious about sending money to help a traveler claiming to be in trouble. When in doubt, contact your local police department for advice and assistance. Be wary of promises to protect a loved one from harm, or to help the loved one out of trouble, in exchange for money. That’s extortion – contact your local police department. Romantic interest is often feigned to attract money from a would-be lover, especially via internet communication. When in doubt, contact your local police department.",
      "If you are being targeted for financial scams, you will need to file a report with your local police department.",
      "General notes for victims of crime : U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault and violent crime should first contact the police and then the U.S. Embassy for assistance.",

      "Road Conditions and Safety: While in Jordan, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning Jordan is provided for general reference only and may not be completely accurate in a particular location or circumstance. U.S. Embassy Amman has advised its employees to avoid driving at night outside the Amman metropolitan area due to road conditions, poorly lighted rural roads, and erratic behavior by other drivers. It is typical for drivers in Jordan not to signal for turns or lane changes. Drivers tend to be aggressive, and cars operate very closely together on highways. Jordanian roads are particularly treacherous during the rainy season, which runs from December to March. Heavy snowfall occurred in 2013 and 2014, making many roads – even major highways – impassable for several days. Driving in Amman is also more hazardous in the summer months of June to September when Jordan experiences an influx of visitors from other countries in the region. Highway traffic is heavy around the Muslim holidays when many Jordanian expatriates return to Jordan for family visits. The Desert Highway outside Aqaba, as well as the Dead Sea Highway from Amman, both popular tourist destinations, are dangerous because they are narrow, winding, steep, and crowded with trucks. Try to avoid using these roads at night. When driving in both urban and rural areas, motorists should beware of unmarked speed bumps and livestock, including camels, sheep, and goats. Collisions between livestock and automobiles are common. As a result of these factors, traffic accidents are frequent and continue to be the largest cause of injury and death in Jordan.",
      "Traffic Laws:",
      "Drivers must have a valid Jordanian license or a valid foreign license with an International Driving Permit to drive in Jordan. U.S. visitors who intend to drive should obtain an International Driving Permit before travel to Jordan. Temporary visitors may use their valid American driver's licenses only to rent “green” plated rental cars. Drivers and passengers are required to wear seatbelts. All cars must have a fire extinguisher and warning triangle in the vehicle. Child car seats are not required by law. Fines for speeding can exceed $140. Talking on a cell phone while driving is prohibited. If stopped by police, drivers may face a fine.",
      "Police routinely pull over reckless drivers, as well as those believed to be driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.",
      "Insurance: Licensed drivers must carry local third-party insurance with sufficient coverage for accidents resulting in injury or death. Drivers who are involved in an accident should remain at the scene and immediately call the police and emergency personnel in case injuries have occurred. Police frequently hold the driver’s license or passport in order to prevent the driver from fleeing. Identification documents can be recovered at the police station. It is common for drivers to blame a U.S. citizen driver for accidents, regardless of the actual circumstances of the incident. Following an accident, the other party may file criminal or civil charges to seek damages. U.S. citizen drivers have occasionally been detained by police as a result. The U.S. Embassy recommends that U.S. citizen drivers in a traffic accident retain private legal counsel .",
      "Taxis: Jordan has abundant taxi services. Please see the Crime section for more information on sexual harassment and assault involving taxi drivers, as well as safety tips when using public or private transportation. Visitors should make arrangements for taxis via their hotel and request that drivers not pick up additional passengers en route to their destinations. We do not recommend other forms of public transportation. Jordanian security authorities often establish checkpoints, especially on roads leading to popular tourist destinations, where drivers are expected to stop and present their identity documents. All drivers should stop when directed to do so and comply with the instructions provided to them by the authorities. Emergencies should be referred to the Civil Defense Department at telephone number 199. Visit the website of Jordan’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities . For information on driving regulations, please contact the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan at 3504 International Drive NW, Washington, DC 20008, by telephone at (202) 966-2664.",

      "Modern medical care and medicines are generally available in Jordan’s main cities, but not always in outlying areas. Most acute and chronic medical conditions can be appropriately handled. When called, ambulance vehicles are often slow to arrive and personnel generally have only a basic level of training. Most hospitals in Jordan, especially in Amman, are privately owned. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment or a high deposit for services. Seasonal dust storms that envelop the country for days or weeks each spring may significantly aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma or sinus problems.",

      "The Jordanian constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press; however, in practice the government has imposed some restrictions on these rights. Insulting the King or members of the Royal Family may lead to detainment or imprisonment. Additionally, activities that the Jordanian government considers proselytizing to Muslims (including the distribution of religious material) are forbidden under the law and anyone undertaking these activities is subject to prosecution, imprisonment, and deportation. Please see the information below on Islam as the state religion of Jordan.",
      "Jordan has very strict drug laws; drug offenses fall under the umbrella of state security and adhere to a different set of criminal procedures than other offenses. Accused offenders can be detained for up to two weeks without charges; this delay can result in the Embassy not being notified about the detainment because an official arrest has not taken place. It is illegal to use and/or distribute drugs in Jordan. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.",
      "Travel Holds: Under Jordanian law, any adult male may prevent his minor children from leaving Jordan by simply registering a hold on their travel with the Jordanian authorities. Husbands may place travel holds on their wives pursuant to a court order from a Jordanian court. Adult male relatives (uncles, brothers, grandfathers) may also petition Jordanian courts for a travel hold on their unmarried adult female relatives. Immigration officials may prevent minor children traveling with their mothers from departing Jordan without the father’s affirmative consent. This is possible even if the child or woman holds only U.S. nationality. Jordanian authorities consider disputes surrounding travel holds as private family matters, and the Embassy is limited in its ability to intervene. Travel holds may only be removed by the person who placed them or by a court. Please see the section below on Children’s Issues. Male Military Requirement: U.S. citizen males who also hold Jordanian citizenship may be subject to laws that impose military service obligations on Jordanians. Jordanian men under age 40 are required to register for service in the Jordanian military. Those subject to registration may be prevented from leaving Jordan until exit permission is obtained from appropriate Jordanian authorities. This permission is often granted to U.S. citizens, but may take some time to obtain and may be limited to a single exit.",
      "Dual Citizenship: The Government of Jordan considers U.S.-Jordanian dual nationals to be Jordanian citizens. Local authorities typically do not notify the U.S. Embassy of arrests, detentions, or accidents involving dual nationals. For this reason, dual nationals in particular should carry copies of their U.S. passports with them at all times so that evidence of their identity and U.S. citizenship is readily available for local authorities.",
      "For additional information, see our information on Dual Nationality . Customs: Jordanian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Jordan of items such as drugs, firearms, poisons, chemicals, explosives, pornographic materials, communications equipment, and antiquities, among other items. You should contact the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Washington, D.C., or one of the Jordanian consulates in the United States, if you seek specific information regarding customs requirements. Please also refer to our Customs Information page for additional information.",
      "Faith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . Islam is the state religion of Jordan. The Jordanian government generally does not interfere in religious practices. Some religious groups, however, cannot obtain legal recognition of their denominations. On official documents such as birth and wedding certificates, the Government of Jordan only allows affiliation with legally recognized faiths: Islam, certain Christian churches, and Judaism. Not listing an affiliated faith, or listing a faith outside those recognized by the government, is generally not permitted. Activities such as proselytizing or encouraging conversion to any faith other than Islam are prohibited. U.S. citizens have been detained, arrested, and deported for discussing or trying to engage Jordanians in discussions about religion, even if such discussions also involve other activities, such as humanitarian aid. LGBTI Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual relations are not illegal in Jordan. However, homosexual behavior is not considered culturally acceptable. Foreigners exhibiting such behavior are likely to be subject to harassment by individuals, including authorities, or potentially targeted by violence. Laws against adultery or breaches of modesty may be used against homosexual travelers. Gay and lesbian Jordanians frequently hide their sexuality, especially from family members. Family members who discover that a relative is LGBTI may target them for “honor” killing. The Jordanian government does not grant or recognize same-sex marriage. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While in Jordan, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is found in the United States . Outside of a few of the more expensive hotels in the capital, individuals with disabilities will find almost no accessible accommodations. Similarly there are very few accessible restaurants, shops, or historical sites. Transportation is not accessible and sidewalks and crosswalks, even in the main cities, are not accessible.

      "Women from Western countries visiting and residing in Jordan have reported incidents of sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, and assault. The Embassy continues to receive sporadic reports regarding incidents of sexual assaults involving taxis and taxi drivers. Many of the incidents have involved verbal sexual harassment, staring, or following the victim. Some have included physical assaults. To reduce the likelihood of being victimized, foreign women should take precautions such as avoiding travel to unfamiliar areas at night, not traveling alone, not riding in the front seat of a taxi, and consider dressing modestly when in public. We also recommend carrying a cell phone at all times. Immediately report any incidents to the Family Protection Department, which is part of the national police.",

      "Terrorism and Organized Criminal Activity: The threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Transnational and indigenous terrorist groups have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. The Department of State remains concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks, kidnappings, and other violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests overseas. Violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Jabhat al-Nusra continue to pose a threat. The potential for terrorist activity is heightened as Jordan participates in the coalition against ISIL.",
      "Travelers to Jordan should be aware that violent extremist groups have carried out terrorist activities against U.S. and Government of Jordan (GOJ) targets in Jordan. On June 6, 2016, a gunman killed five Jordanian government employees in an attack on a security office in Baqaa, north of Amman. On June 21, 2016, ISIL conducted a car bomb attack against a Jordanian military facility located in the country’s northeast near the border with Syria. In November 2015, a Jordanian police officer killed two U.S. citizen trainers and wounded two others in a shooting at the Jordan International Police Training Center (JIPTC) outside Amman. He also killed a South African trainer and two Jordanian interpreters. All five personnel killed were working on U.S.-supported programs at the facility. Travelers to Jordan should be aware of potentially dangerous areas along Jordan’s border with Syria and Iraq. All U.S. government personnel on official travel must receive prior permission to visit any area within 10 kilometers from the Jordan-Syria border. For context, the town of Ramtha falls within the 10 kilometer line. The 10 kilometer area does not include the tourist site of Umm Qais or the city of Irbid. U.S. government personnel must have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraqi border, due to Jordanian military activity, known smuggling routes, and a lack of emergency facilities.",
      "Terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. Terrorists may target areas frequented by Westerners, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, liquor stores, shopping malls, transportation hubs, places of worship, expatriate residential areas, and schools. In light of these security concerns, U.S. citizens should maintain a high level of vigilance:",

      "Demonstrations: Demonstrations are common. Some, especially smaller ones, have turned violent, leading security officials to intervene. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can become violent, so travelers should avoid all protests and large gatherings of people. Many demonstrations occur on Fridays near mosques following noon prayers. You should exercise special sensitivity and caution when visiting or traveling near mosques and religious sites during holy days and Fridays. Demonstrations and other forms of unrest have occurred on public university campuses in Jordan. Some acts of violence on university campuses have involved the use of firearms. Anti-U.S. demonstrations have also taken place in front of the U.S. Embassy.",
      "Tribal Violence: Clashes between feuding tribes, clans, or families periodically erupt without notice and sometimes involve an escalation in violence, including the use of firearms. In some cases, Jordanian security services are slow to respond or may opt to let the violence subside before intervening. Syria and Iraq Borders: U.S. citizens should avoid the border areas with Syria and Iraq. Police and security officials have arrested weapon and drug smugglers, as well as foreign fighters attempting to enter Syria to fight in the country’s ongoing civil war. Fighting can occur close to the Syrian border, and some munitions have landed within Jordan’s borders. On June 21, 2016 ISIL conducted a car bomb attack against a Jordanian military facility in the country’s northeast border with Syria, killing seven Jordanian security forces. The Department of State advises against travel into Syria and Iraq. Please see the Travel Warnings and Country Specific Information for Syria and Iraq for further information. CRIME: Statistically, petty crime is the most common form that U.S. citizens and other Western nationals experience in Jordan, especially at tourist sites and in crowded areas. Pickpockets, purse snatchers, and opportunistic thieves are known to target foreigners in the narrow and crowded streets of the older parts of Amman’s city center. Travelers should be guarded in these areas and in all tourist locations in Jordan. Jordanian police have warned the public to exercise vigilance when leaving banks or ATMs, to reduce likelihood of targeting by thieves.",
      "Thefts of vehicles, assaults, robbery, and attempted residential break-ins have also been reported. Take care not to display valuables in your car or on your person, and be sure to lock car doors and windows. Violent crime is increasing, but U.S. citizens or other Westerners are rarely targeted. In the past, the Embassy has received reports of firearms being discharged at vehicles being driven by Westerners. Celebratory gunfire is common, especially during major festivals, sporting events, or the biannual release of high school test scores. Don’t buy counterfeit or pirated goods. Not only are the pirated copies illegal in the United States, if you purchase them, you will also be breaking local law. Most DVDs, CDs, and software available for sale in Jordan are pirated.",

One of the greatest threats to travelers in Kenya is road safety. The information below concerning Kenya is provided for general reference only and may not be completely accurate in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "In Kenya, traffic moves on the left side of the road, which can be very disorienting to those not accustomed to it. Excessive speed, unpredictable local driving habits and manners, poor vehicle maintenance, bumpy, potholed, and unpaved roads, and the lack of basic safety equipment on many vehicles are daily hazards on Kenyan roads. When there is a heavy traffic jam, either due to rush hour or because of an accident, drivers will drive across the median strip and drive directly toward oncoming traffic.",
      "There are often fatal accidents involving long-distance, inter-city buses, or local buses called “matatus.” Matatus are known to be the greatest danger to other vehicles or pedestrians on the road. Many U.S. citizens have been killed or seriously injured in motor vehicle-related accidents. Inter-city night-time road travel should be avoided due to the poor road and street light conditions, and the threat of banditry throughout the country.",
      "During the rainy season, some unpaved roads are impassable even with four-wheel drive vehicles with high clearance. Travelers are urged to consult with local officials regarding road conditions.",
      "Travel via passenger train in Kenya is considered unsafe, particularly during rainy seasons, because of the lack of routine maintenance and safety checks. The Kenya Railway service operates only two days a week. The service from Nairobi to Malaba is now only a cargo service and no longer transports passengers.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information.",
      "AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT: There are no direct commercial flights between the United States and Kenya.

Meningococcal meningitis outbreaks exist throughout the country, but primarily in the far northwest counties near the borders with South Sudan, Ethiopia, and northern Uganda.

For information that can help you and your doctor decide which antimalarial prevention would be best for you, please see CDC’s “ Choosing a Drug to Prevent Malaria .” Travelers who become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling in a malaria-risk area, or up to one year after returning home, should seek prompt medical attention and speak to their physician about their travel history and use of anti-malarial drugs.",
      "Diarrheal illness, including cholera, is very common among travelers even in large cities and luxury accommodations. Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through scrupulous washing of hands and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating. The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk (see Food &amp; Water Safety ). Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them. Drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice (because it may have been made from unclean water). Talk to your doctor about short-course antibiotics and loperamide to carry with you while traveling in case of diarrhea.",

Avoid wading, swimming, bathing, or washing in bodies of fresh water such as canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs. Additionally, avoid drinking in bodies of fresh water such as canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs. Risk is highest in Lake Victoria, the Tana River, and along the southeastern coast.

Kenya does not routinely comply with its VCCR obligation. Any U.S. citizen who is detained should request U.S. Embassy notification if he/she would like consular assistance.

It is advisable to contact the Embassy of Kenya or one of Kenya’s consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.",
      "Visitors should be aware of Kenya’s Alcoholic Drinks Control Act of 2010, which regulates when and where alcoholic drinks may be consumed in public. The regulations are strict and difficult to follow. For example, certain restaurants are authorized to sell alcoholic drinks on any day of the week to persons having meals in the restaurant, for consumption with such meals, from Monday to Friday during the hours of 5.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m., and during weekends and public holidays during the hours of 2.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m. Nightclubs have different licenses, most of which allow alcohol to be consumed until 3:00 a.m., while hotels do not have any restrictions on alcohol consumption. More information on this law may be found on Kenya's substance abuse website, NACADA . The police sporadically enforce these laws and have arrested some tourists found in violation. The Tobacco Control Act 2007 regulates public smoking and the marketing and sale of tobacco products in Kenya. In public places, smoking is allowed only in designated smoking areas. If an individual is discovered smoking outside these designated areas, a substantial fine may be imposed.",
      "Up to 100,000 Kenyan shillings may be taken out of the country. Destruction of Kenyan currency, even in small amounts, is illegal, and almost always results in arrest and a fine.

Travelers are advised that, even in the most serene settings, animals are wild and can present a threat to life and safety. In addition, potentially dangerous areas may lack fences and warning signs. Travelers are cautioned to observe all local or park regulations and exercise appropriate caution in unfamiliar surroundings. Travelers are advised to thoroughly check the qualifications and safety record of all tourist lodges and guides before engaging their services and venturing into the wild in their care.

      "LGBT RIGHTS: Although authorities have rarely prosecuted persons for engaging in same gender sexual activity, it is a criminal act in Kenya. The Kenyan penal code criminalizes “carnal knowledge against the order of nature,” which is interpreted to prohibit consensual same-sex sexual activity, and specifies a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment. A separate statute specifically criminalizes sex between men and specifies a maximum penalty of 21 years’ imprisonment. Police have detained persons under these laws, particularly suspected sex workers, but released them shortly afterward. Travelers should be aware of cultural norms as well as the risk of possible arrest and imprisonment for such activities. Kenya is a relatively conservative society. Overt public displays of affection between persons of the opposite gender will likely garner serious disapproval, particularly in rural areas. Public displays of affection between persons of the same gender also risk serious disapproval, and possibly violence. LGBT advocacy organizations, such as the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya, have been permitted to register and conduct activities. However, societal discrimination based on sexual orientation is widespread. Violence against the LGBT community has also occurred, particularly in rural areas and among refugees. NGO groups report that police have intervened to stop attacks, but generally have not been sympathetic to LGBT individuals or concerns. For more detailed information about LGBT rights in Kenya, you may review the State Department’s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices . LGBT travelers should review the LGBT Travel Information page .",
      "ACCESSIBILITY: While in Kenya, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States . Although Kenyan law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, the government has not effectively enforced these provisions and implementation has been slow. Very few government or private buildings, medical facilities, restaurants or other public or private facilities have adequate access for the disabled. Travelers to Kenya will find very little accessibility to public transportation or taxis. There is no functioning bus system in Nairobi, but rather an extensive use of vans (“matatus”) that travel along designated routes, or taxis. Neither of these options can easily accommodate wheelchairs and most often are hailed from the side of busy roads. Footpaths along the side of roads are generally unpaved, bumpy, dirt paths with unmarked road crossings.",

      "CRIME : Crime is rampant, indiscriminant, at times violent, and happens in all parts of Kenya. Violent and sometimes fatal criminal attacks, including home invasions, burglaries, armed carjackings, grenade attacks, and kidnappings can occur at any time and in any location. U.S. citizens, including U.S. Embassy employees, have been victims of such crimes within the past year. Crime is high in all regions of Kenya, particularly Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and at coastal beach resorts. There are regular reports of attacks against tourists by groups of armed assailants. Pickpockets and thieves carry out &quot;snatch and run&quot; crimes on city streets and near crowds. Thieves on motorcycles will assault pedestrians and speed away. Visitors have found it safer not to carry valuables, but rather to store them in hotel safety deposit boxes or safe rooms. However, there have been reports of safes being stolen from hotel rooms and hotel desk staff being forced to open safes. Walking alone or at night, especially in downtown areas, public parks, along footpaths, on beaches, and in poorly lit areas, is dangerous and discouraged.",
      "Nairobi averages about ten vehicle hijackings per day and Kenyan authorities have limited capacity to deter and investigate such acts. Matatus (public transportation) tend to be targeted since they carry up to 14 passengers. Although these attacks are often violent, victims are generally not injured if they do not resist. There is also a high incidence of residential break-ins and occupants should take additional security measures to protect their property. Thieves and con artists have been known to impersonate police officers; thus, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to ask for identification if approached by individuals identifying themselves as police officials, uniformed or not. U.S. citizens have fallen victim to such crimes within the past year. U.S. citizens in Kenya should be extremely vigilant with regard to their personal security, particularly in public places frequented by foreigners such as clubs, hotels, resorts, upscale shopping centers, restaurants, and places of worship. U.S. citizens should also remain alert in residential areas, at schools, and at outdoor recreational events.",
      "Thieves routinely snatch jewelry and other objects from open vehicle windows while motorists are either stopped at traffic lights or in heavy traffic. Vehicle windows should be up and doors locked regardless of the time of day or weather. Thieves on matatus, buses, and trains may steal valuables from inattentive passengers. U.S. citizens should guard their backpacks or hand luggage and ensure these items are not left unattended. Purchasing items from street vendors is strongly discouraged – visitors should only use reputable stores or businesses. Many scams, perpetrated against unsuspecting tourists, are prevalent in and around the city of Nairobi. Many of these involve people impersonating police officers and using fake police ID badges and other credentials. Nevertheless, police checkpoints are common in Kenya and all vehicles are required to stop if directed to do so.",
      "Highway banditry is common in much of Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, and northern Tana River counties, as well as Turkana County. These areas are remote and sparsely populated. Incidents also occur occasionally on Kenya's main highways, particularly after dark. Due to increased bandit activity, air travel is the recommended means of transportation when visiting any of the coastal resorts north of Malindi. Travelers to North Eastern Kenya and the North Rift Valley Region should travel with police escorts or convoys organized by the government of Kenya.",
      "There have been reports of armed banditry in or near many of Kenya's national parks and game reserves, particularly the Samburu, Leshaba, and Masai Mara game reserves. In response, the Kenya Wildlife Service and police have taken steps to strengthen security in the affected areas, but the problem has not been eliminated. Travelers who do not use the services of reputable travel firms or knowledgeable guides or drivers are especially at risk. Safaris are best undertaken with a minimum of two vehicles so that there is a backup in case of mechanical failure or other emergency. Camping alone is always risky.",
      "The Kenyan mail system can be unreliable and monetary instruments (credit cards, checks, etc.) are frequently stolen. International couriers provide the safest means of shipping envelopes and packages, although anything of value should be insured. Also note that credit card fraud has become more prevalent in the last year.",

While the lightly travelled roads of Kirimati are in relatively good condition, the heavily used South Tarawa roads are deteriorating rapidly, and the impact of poor road conditions is significant.

Most roads are narrow, crowded, and used by a variety of vehicles, from KFOR-armored personnel carriers to horse-drawn carts. Mountain roads can be narrow and poorly marked, lack guardrails, and quickly become dangerous in inclement weather. Dense fog can obscure visibility while driving.",
      "Drivers routinely ignore speed limits and traffic regulations (illegal left turns from the far right lane, passing on blind curves, driving into oncoming lanes of traffic without yielding). Many vehicles lack standard front or rear lights. Roads frequently flood and are impassible during rainy months. Mud and road slides occasionally shut down main throughways. Pedestrians should exercise extreme caution when crossing the street, even when using crosswalks. Drivers generally do not slow down or stop for pedestrians. Crowded or isolated locations can increase travelers’ exposure to robbery. The U.S. Embassy recommends that you travel during daylight hours. Leave a travel itinerary and contact telephone numbers with someone before you go.",

Review the Kosovo traffic safety law for complete information on driver’s licenses and imported or foreign-tagged vehicle registration requirements. Drivers of motor vehicles registered outside of Kosovo may need to purchase liability insurance at the border. Drivers may be limited to three months of driving on a U.S. license before needing to obtain a Kosovo license. Kosovo is not a member of the European motor vehicle third party liability (“green card”) system. Public Transportation : Taxis are generally an inexpensive, safe, and reliable means of transportation. It is recommended to use established taxi companies instead of a personally-owned vehicle converted to a taxi. Make sure the taxi has a meter and that the driver activates it upon departure.

Please see the Kazakhstan Embassy’s visa page for the most current visa information.",

For information on official authentication, please see the Department of State website . It is recommended that you obtain the background check before your travel to Kazakhstan, as it may be difficult to have fingerprints taken in Kazakhstan.

While visitors to popular tourist sites within these zones are not required to obtain special permission from immigration authorities, visitors to these sites should bring personal identification in the event they are requested to present it to local authorities. Those wishing to visit other areas within these zones should check with local authorities to ensure that no prior permission is required.",

If the card contains only one stamp, you must register with the Migration Police within five calendar days. Certain hotels throughout Kazakhstan are also able to register foreign guests. While Kazakhstani authorities may register a traveler for up to three months, this does not mean that the traveler can be physically present in Kazakhstan for three months. The duration of stay is dictated by the specific visa category. If you stay longer than three months, you must extend your registration period with the nearest Migration Police office in Kazakhstan. Foreigners must inform the Migration Police of changes of address. Penalties for violating registration rules, including failing to produce a white registration card with proof of registration on departure, may include delayed and/or denial of boarding, fines, imprisonment, and deportation.",

Traffic is chaotic, and road conditions can be rough. Few roads have lane markings, road signs, and stoplights. Drivers widely ignore those that exist. Speeding, reckless passing, and failure to obey traffic laws are common. Many drivers are underage, unlicensed, inexperienced, or uninsured. Driving under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs is common. Motorcycles carry as many as five people, greatly impeding the drivers' ability to react to traffic. Avoid driving at night . Road construction sites are poorly marked, appear with no warning, and can be difficult to see at night. Roads are poorly illuminated, many vehicles have no operating lights, few bicycles have reflectors, and trucks without reflectors commonly park on unlighted roads. Motorcycles: The U.S. Embassy prohibits official Americans in Laos from using motorcycles due to a high incidence of accidents and lack of available medical care. You should also consider not using a motorcycle. Emergency vehicles: There are no government ambulance services, and a scarcity of private ambulances makes it difficult for accident victims to receive timely medical attention.",
      "Traffic Laws:",
      "Traffic accidents: A driver involved in a traffic accident should remain at the scene and attempt to contact the police or wait for the police to arrive to prepare an accident report. If renting a car or motorcycle, contact the rental company and its insurance agent. Traffic moves on the right, but vehicles use all parts of the road. Intoxicated driving: Police rarely enforce intoxicated driving laws.",

There are a limited number of buses and shared van/covered pick-up truck services. Inter-city transport: Provided by buses, vans, pickups, and trucks, any of which may also be in poor repair. For hire vehicles: Taxis or cars-for-hire are only available at major transit hubs such as border crossings and airports. “Tuk-tuks” - three-wheeled, open-sided vehicles - are available in tourist areas, but are frequently in poor repair, and drivers generally speak little to no English. Car taxis are also available by phone.",

While prosecutions are rare, the U.S. Embassy is aware that prosecutions have occurred for consensual same-sex relations between adults. Because homosexuality is taboo in Lebanon, very few people come forward about being arrested on these grounds. The authorities normally arrest people for other minor offenses, and then charge the defendants with violation of Article 534 when other evidence is found of their LGBTI identity. While it is uncommon for people to be prosecuted after arrests, short-term detentions do occur, which can expose individuals to discrimination, and in some cases, abuse.

      "The current Department of State Travel Warning urges U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Lebanon because of the threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence near Lebanon’s borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should understand that they accept the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks. There is potential for death or injury in Lebanon because of terrorist bombings. Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, is a problem in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings sometimes have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations. Public demonstrations occur with little warning and may become violent. You should avoid areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests.",
      "U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon in spite of the Travel Warning should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. Also, the Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens in the country against sudden outbreaks of violence. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice. Security restrictions may prevent access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas of the country, especially in parts of metropolitan Beirut, the city of Tripoli, northern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon.",
      "In the event that the security climate in the country worsens further, U.S. citizens are responsible for arranging their own travel out of Lebanon. U.S. citizens with special medical or other needs should be aware of the risks of remaining given their condition, and they should be prepared to seek treatment in Lebanon if they cannot arrange for travel out of the country.",
      "Crime: The crime rate in Lebanon is moderate, and both car theft and burglaries occur. Violent crime and sexual assault are rare, but do happen. Criminal groups have abducted U.S. citizens for ransom and other motives, on at least one occasion using the lure of a business meeting. The embassy receives regular reports of domestic abuse. Petty theft -- such as pickpocketing and purse snatching -- is common in crowded public areas. Police are responsive but often unable to affect a positive outcome. There are no special concerns with regard to targeted victimization of U.S. citizens in scams or confidence schemes.",
      "There have been incidents involving a theft ring that appear to target foreigners using service cars. Service cars are privately owned vehicles bearing red license plates that act as public transportation for multiple passengers at once. Because of the risks inherent in using any unknown transportation, U.S. citizens should be wary of these service cars and carry the number of a reputable taxi company in case of emergencies.",

The Government of Lebanon has the authority to refuse admission to U.S. citizens and to detain U.S. citizen travelers for further inspection. Travelers who have previously worked in Lebanon without the appropriate work visa may be denied entry, or subject to detention or deportation. Travelers who have overstayed their entry visa validity in Lebanon must adjust their status with General Security’s Department of Passport and Immigration and receive an exit visa prior to their departure. Individuals who are detained pending deportation are expected to pay the cost of their own airline ticket and will remain under detention until they have gathered the necessary funds. Citizens applying for work or residency permits will have to submit their passports to General Security, which may retain their documents for an extended period.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in a foreign country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning Liberia is provided for general reference only, and may not be accurate in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "Driving in Liberia presents a danger to residents and visitors, as traffic laws are either nonexistent or not enforced. Traffic accidents are frequent and often result in injury or loss of life. Potholes and poor road surfaces are common, making safe driving extremely challenging. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, and taxis are often overloaded with people and goods, and vehicles make frequent stops without signaling. Drivers overtake on the right lanes as well as the left lanes. Many vehicles operate with threadbare tires, and blowouts are frequent. Public taxis are poorly maintained and usually overloaded. All drivers should approach intersections with extreme caution. Public street lights have been installed in some locations in Monrovia and there are a few traffic lights around city. However, drivers outside of Monrovia should remain vigilant as pedestrians, animals, and unrestricted speed limits are attributed to many fatal collisions.",
      "Drivers and pedestrians are cautioned that high-speed car convoys carrying government officials require all other vehicles to pull off the road until they have passed.",
      "Travelers should expect time-consuming detours around the many bridges and roads damaged by war, neglect, or the heavy annual rains occurring between May and November. Travelers can expect strict enforcement of border controls by Liberian, Ivorian, Sierra Leonean, and Guinean authorities. Corruption has been reported at many border locations and travelers may be asked for money prior to crossing the border. At times, border crossings to neighboring countries are closed.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the website of Liberia’s national tourist office .",
      "AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Liberia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Liberia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page ."

    "health": [
      "Hospitals and medical facilities in Liberia are poorly equipped and are incapable of providing many services. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. For serious medical problems, U.S. citizens in Liberia should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment. Within Liberia, medicines are scarce, often beyond expiration dates, and generally unavailable in most areas; additionally counterfeit medications, often very well packaged, are common in pharmacies throughout the country. As there is neither an effective garbage removal service nor a functioning sewer system, sanitation throughout urban areas is very poor, which increases the potential for disease. Upper respiratory infections and diarrhea are common, as well as more serious diseases such as typhoid and malaria.",
      "Mosquito borne illnesses such as malaria and yellow fever are a significant problem and prevention of bites and proper yellow fever immunization are important for all areas. Travelers should carry and use insect repellents containing either 20 percent DEET, picaridin, and oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535. Treating clothing and tents with permethrin and sleeping in screened or air conditioned rooms under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets will help diminish bites from mosquitoes as well as ticks, fleas, and chiggers, some of which may also carry infections.",
      "Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is highly prevalent throughout Liberia in all seasons in both cities and rural settings. Before traveling to Liberia you should discuss with your doctor the best antimalarial medication to avoid malaria which should be taken for even short visits confined to Monrovia.",
      "Atovaquone-proguanil ( Malarone ), doxycycline, or mefloquine ( Lariam ) are appropriate antimalarials for this region. Chloroquine is not recommended due to the high incidence of resistance. For information that can help you and your doctor decide which of these drugs would be best for you, please see Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Choosing a Drug to Prevent Malaria . If you become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling in Liberia, or for up to one year after returning home, you should seek prompt medical attention. Tell the physician your travel history and what antimalarials you have been taking.",
      "Yellow fever is a virus spread by day biting mosquitoes (in contrast to the night biting malaria carrying mosquitoes). Although rare among travelers, yellow fever can be severe or fatal in 10 percent of those infected and there is no treatment available. It can be nearly 100 percent prevented through use of the yellow fever vaccine which is required for entry into Liberia for anyone over one year of age and recommended for all those over nine months of age.",
      "All routinely recommended immunizations for the United States should be up to date as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, and chicken pox are much more common than in Liberia, especially among children.",
      "Typhoid and Hepatitis A are common in Liberia and immunization is recommended for all travelers.",
      "Rabies immunization is recommended for all travelers staying for more than four weeks, who will have remote rural travel, or expect animal exposure. Even in urban areas, dogs may have rabies. Bites and scratches from dogs, bats, or other mammals should be immediately cleaned with soap and water and medical evaluation sought to determine if additional rabies immunization is warranted.",
      "Diarrheal illness is very common among travelers, even in large cities and luxury accommodations. Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through scrupulous washing of hands and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating. The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk, see Food &amp; Water Safety . Eat only food that is cooked and served hot and avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them. Drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice because it could be made from unclean water.",
      "Tuberculosis is more than 20 times more common in Liberia than in the United States. Those planning on extended stays or extensive contact with local populations should consider tuberculin skin testing before travel and then again six to twelve weeks after returning from Liberia.",
      "Schistosomiasis is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread by fresh water snails. The larval stage of the worm can burrow through your skin when in contact with contaminated fresh water. Avoid wading, swimming, bathing, or washing in, or drinking from bodies of fresh water such as canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs, especially in Bong County.",
      "The filarial infection onchocerciasis , transmitted by black flies, is highly endemic. Exposure of longer than two weeks is generally required for infection. Daytime insect precautions are recommended, especially near the shores of rivers.",
      "Lassa fever , a viral infection transmitted from exposure to rodent urine and feces is endemic in Liberia, causing fatal infection annually, mainly in rural areas. Travelers are advised to avoid rodents and their excreta and ensure that camp sites and bedding are not infested with rodents.",
      "Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) was first detected in Liberia in March 2014. The EVD outbreak crossed into Liberia in the remote border region with Guinea. Travelers are considered at very low risk of infection but are advised to avoid handling or consuming bushmeat to include bats, monkeys, gorillas, and other primates that appear to be responsible for starting human outbreaks of EVD.",

In other places, driving under the influence of alcohol could land you immediately in jail. These criminal penalties will vary from country to country.",

You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",
      "Persons violating Liberian laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Liberia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.",

      "If you are arrested in Liberia, you should immediately request that authorities contact the U.S. Embassy.",
      "Infrastructure: Lodging, fuel, transportation, and telephone services are not consistently available. Services can be nonexistent or severely limited in rural areas. Neither running water nor electricity is commercially available in Liberia, except in some parts of Monrovia. Most hotels have utilities available, but not always on a 24-hour basis. There is no working landline telephone system in Liberia. Several cell phone companies provide service in Monrovia and some areas outside the capital. U.S. cellular phones do not always work in Liberia and it is advisable to rent or purchase a local cellular phone. The postal system is slow and unreliable. Commercial air courier service is available through UPS, FedEx, and DHL.",
      "Financial Issues: The Liberian dollar is the official currency; however, the U.S. dollar is accepted as legal tender and is used alongside the Liberian dollar. While there is no limit on the amount of foreign currency that can be transported into and out of the country, sums in excess of $10,000 USD must be reported at the port of entry, and no more than $7,500 USD in foreign currency banknotes can be moved out of the country at one time. Larger sums must be transferred via bank drafts or other financial instruments. Persons without a Liberian bank account may be limited in the amount of over-the-counter cash wire transfers per month, and will likely be subject to substantial fees. ATMs are not widely available. Traveler's checks and credit cards are not regularly accepted, except at some major hotels in Monrovia. There have been some reports of financial information being compromised even at hotels where credit cards are routinely accepted. Nearly all transactions are made with cash, and Liberian dollars are preferred for smaller purchases, especially outside of Monrovia.",
      "Swimming Hazard: Liberia has many excellent beaches along the Atlantic coastline that can be enjoyed throughout the year. However, U.S. citizens should be aware of the threat of dangerous rip currents, also known as rip tides. These strong currents can occur anywhere on the coast given the right surf conditions. The Liberia Weather Service does not provide information on where and when these tides form, and there are no lifeguards posted on beaches. Do not swim in the Atlantic if you are unfamiliar with swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur",

Before traveling to Liberia, U.S. citizens are urged to make arrangements for transportation from the international airport into the city center. Taxis are the only form of public transportation available at the international airport, which is located 40 miles outside of Monrovia. Taxis generally carry multiple passengers to various stops and are poorly maintained. See section on traffic safety and road conditions for additional information. U.S. citizens traveling to Liberia are also urged to confirm reservations at a reputable hotel, as rooms can be scarce and difficult to find without advance plans.",
      "U.S. citizens who travel to or reside in Liberia should realize that Liberia's police force has limited resources. UN Police (UNPOL) officers serve as advisors to the Liberia National Police, but they do not have the authority to arrest or detain, and most are unarmed. The Liberia National Police has a strong presence in Monrovia, but less of a presence outside of the capital city. The police can be both a source of assistance as well as a source of problems for visitors. Concerns about police corruption continue, and travelers may be detained by police officers soliciting bribes. U.S. citizens are encouraged to carry a photocopy of their passports with them at all times so that, if questioned by local officials, proof of identity and citizenship is readily available. If detained or arrested, U.S. citizens should ask to contact the U.S. Embassy immediately.",

An increasing number of U.S. citizens have been the target of such scams. The best way to avoid becoming a victim of fraud is to use common sense – if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. U.S. citizens should carefully check any unsolicited business proposal originating in Liberia before committing any funds, providing any goods or services, or undertaking any travel, particularly if the proposal involves mining or the sale of gold and diamonds.

After comprehensive peace accords ended the conflict in August 2003, a United Nations peacekeeping force (UNMIL) was deployed to facilitate disarmament and demobilization, help arrange democratic elections, and provide for security of the country. In late 2005, Liberians elected Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf as president. She was re-elected in November 2011, and her administration continues to make progress in rebuilding the country.",

A few main rural highways are comparable to U.S. two-lane rural roads, but lane markings, signs, shoulders and guardrails do not meet U.S. standards. Lesotho's mountainous terrain makes driving on secondary roads hazardous. Unpaved roads in the interior—often narrow, winding, and steep—are poorly maintained. For travel in the interior, especially in wet or snowy weather, a high ground clearance or four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended. Four-wheel-drive is also a requirement for entering or departing Lesotho through the Sani Pass on the eastern border. The authority for road safety issues rests with the Lesotho Mounted Police Service ; there are no auto clubs or reliable ambulance services. Drivers should contact the police in case of road emergencies.",

Rental cars are available in Maseru, and cars rented in neighboring South Africa may be brought into Lesotho with the written permission of the rental company.",

Outside of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia has few paved roads and even fewer street lights. Most of the roads have only two lanes and no shoulders; most of the sealed roads need resurfacing. Trucks commonly carry overloaded cargo. Mongolian motorists are aggressive, commonly cutting each other off, performing illegal turns, driving through red lights, and/or suddenly stopping in the middle of the road. Moreover, driving under the influence is common. Although Mongolia is a right-hand traffic country, more than half of all vehicles have the steering wheel on the right-hand side. Most motorcycle and moped drivers have limited experience sharing the road.",

Participants of the 2016 Mongol Rally reported that Mongolian roads – and road conditions – are the roughest of the entire 10,000-mile course. Those contemplating off-road driving through Mongolia should bring standard vehicle maintenance equipment, a good GPS unit, and a reliable satellite phone. Use extreme caution before driving off-road during the winter. Mongolia’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) is highly capable of assisting stuck vehicles. However, off-road rescue can take days given the remoteness and rough terrain, and few NEMA rescue crews speak English.",

U.S. citizen tourists may legally drive in Mongolia for up to six months with a valid international driver’s license, but must have a Mongolian license thereafter. Automobile insurance is mandatory. For information concerning Mongolian driver’s licenses, vehicle inspection, road taxes, and vehicle insurance, contact the Embassy of Mongolia in Washington, DC. If you are involved in a collision, never move your vehicle until after the police arrive to assess the scene-- even if your vehicle is blocking traffic. Moving your vehicle will incur an almost certain fine.",

      "Mongolia is a relatively safe country for foreigners. However, both street crime and violent crime are on the rise, especially in the larger towns and cities. Crime typically peaks during the Naadam summer festival in July and during the Tsagaan Sar (Lunar New Year) festival in January or February.",
      "Petty street crime such as pickpocketing and bag-snatching can occur at any time, especially in crowded places like open markets, train stations, and popular tourist attractions. Other street crime most often occurs late at night, often outside of bars and nightclubs. Muggings are on the rise. Muggings are most likely to occur if you are alone in unfamiliar urban neighborhoods after dark, or in unregistered taxis or private vehicles operating as taxis. Stick to well-lit and well-established tourist areas, and use radio taxis whenever possible. Be cautious when approached by strangers , particularly late at night. Friendly locals may, for example, strike up a conversation, offer a beverage--which later causes loss of consciousness--and rob you. Be cautious at tourist sites. Female travelers should join larger tour groups when visiting monasteries and when patronizing ger camps. In 2016, we received three reports of sexual assault against foreign females who were visiting popular monasteries. In each case, a monk isolated the foreign tourist during her tour. We also received several reports of thieves entering the gers of female travelers late at night to steal valuables. One of these incidents also involved sexual assault. Unprovoked xenophobic attacks against foreigners also occur. The attackers often target Asian-Americans and interracial couples – particularly foreign men with Mongolian or other Asian women – for verbal or physical abuse. These assaults typically stem from incidents in bars and nightclubs, but can also be premeditated attacks by nationalist groups. Smuggling is prevalent across the Chinese and Russian borders. Be wary of other passengers requesting help with their luggage, which might contain illicit articles. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.",

      "Cultural Property: Mali is a signatory to the Treaty on Cultural Property, which restricts exportation of Malian archeological objects, in particular those from the Niger River Valley. Visitors seeking to export any such property are required by Malian law to obtain an export authorization from the National Museum in Bamako. Contact the Embassy of Mali in Washington D.C. or the nearest Malian consulate for specific information regarding customs requirements. U.S. Customs and Border Protection may impose corresponding import restrictions in accordance with the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act.",
      "Currency/Access to Funds: Currency exchange facilities are slow and often use out-of-date exchange rates. The U.S. Embassy is unable to provide exchange facilities for private U.S. citizens. There are several ATMs in Bamako that accept U.S. citizens’ credit/debit cards, though they do not function reliably. Maximum withdrawals are generally limited to $400, and local banks charge up to $20 per transaction for use of their ATMs. There are some ATMs outside of Bamako in Segou, Sikasso, Koutiala, Gao, and Mopti, though they are sporadic and occasionally inoperable. Credit cards are accepted only at the largest hotels, Banque Atlantique, a few travel agencies (for an extra fee), and very few select restaurants. Cash advances from credit cards are available in Mali only via Western Union.",
      "Photography: Exercise caution when taking photographs in Mali. Photographing any official object, entity, or person is restricted. These restrictions include infrastructure, facilities, government buildings, as well as individuals. You should obtain explicit permission from the Malian government before photographing transportation facilities and government buildings. Taking a photograph without permission in any public area or around any of the above listed facilities often provokes a prompt response from security personnel or offends the people being photographed. Taking photos of the U.S. Embassy in Bamako is prohibited.",

      "Roads in France are generally comparable to those in the United States, but traffic engineering and driving habits pose special dangers. Lane markings and sign placements may not be clear. Drivers should be prepared to make last-minute maneuvers. French drivers typically drive more aggressively and faster than U.S. drivers, and tend to exceed posted speed limits. Right-of-way rules in France differ from those in the United States. Drivers entering intersections from the right have priority over those on the left (unless specifically indicated otherwise), even when entering relatively large boulevards from small side streets. While many newer traffic circles have yield signs, some intersections do not, and still require traffic in the circle to cede the right-of-way to incoming traffic from the right.",
      "On major highways, there are service stations at least every 25 miles. Service stations are not as common on secondary roads in France as they are in the United States. Paris has an extensive and efficient public transportation system. The interconnecting system of buses, subways, and commuter rails serves more than four million people a day with a safety record comparable to, or better than, the systems of major U.S. cities. Similar transportation systems are found in all major French cities. Between cities, France has an equally extensive rail service, which is safe and reliable. High-speed rail links connect the major cities in France. Many cities are also served by frequent air service. Traveling by train is safer than driving.",
      "Pedestrians make up 13 percent of the deaths in motor vehicle accidents in France (roughly the same as in the United States), but this percentage is increasing. Most of these accidents occur when a pedestrian steps out onto the street, often when a car or motorcycle is making a turn through a pedestrian crosswalk. Pedestrians should be cautious even when they have a green walking signal since this is no guarantee against aggressive drivers.",
      "While Paris, Marseille, Lyon, and other French cities actively encourage bicycle rentals through widely available city-sponsored systems, you should be cautious about this means of transportation, especially in a busy and unfamiliar urban environment.

Large demonstrations in Paris are generally managed by a strong police presence, but even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We recommend that U.S. citizens avoid demonstrations if possible, and exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations. The congestion caused by large demonstrations can cause serious inconveniences for a visitor on a tight schedule. Some sporting events, such as soccer matches, have occasionally degenerated into violence that continued into the streets.",

French authorities have periodically spoken publicly about the heightened threat conditions for terrorist attacks in Europe. The United States and France routinely share information in order to disrupt terrorist plotting, identify and take action against potential operatives, and strengthen defenses against potential threats.",

      "General: France is a relatively safe country. Most crimes are non-violent, but pick-pocketing is a significant problem. The same is true for Monaco. See the section below entitled “Tips on How to Avoid Becoming a Victim.”",
      "The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing, residential break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft with minimal violence. However, as in any big city, robberies involving physical assault do occur in Paris and other major urban areas. Visitors to congested areas and known tourist sites (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Crimes against visitors are generally crimes of opportunity, though these crimes are more likely to involve violence on the street late at night or when the victim detects the theft and resists the criminal. As in any major city, women should exercise extra caution when out alone at night and/or consider traveling out at night with companions. In general, Paris taxis are safe and professionally operated, but there has been an increase in reported harassment and assaults on women by taxi drivers.",
      "Caution is required throughout France when driving through economically depressed areas where there is a high incidence of “smash and grab” robberies. Thieves will approach a vehicle that is stopped in traffic, smash a window, reach into the vehicle to grab a purse or other valuable item, and then flee. Keep doors locked and valuables out of sight.",
      "There is generally an increase in the number of residential break-ins in August, when most French residents take vacation, and in December. The majority are attributed to residents not using security measures already in place, including double-locking doors and locking windows. Home invasions are often preceded by phone calls to see if the resident is at home. Often thieves who manage to gain access to the apartment building will knock on apartment doors to see if anyone answers, offering the excuse they are taking a survey or representing a utility company.",
      "PARIS: Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively uncommon in the city center, but women should exercise extra caution when out alone at night, and should consider traveling out at night with trusted companions. There has been an increase in reported sexual harassment, and sometimes assault, by taxi drivers.",
      "Pickpockets are by far the most significant problem. In addition to purses and wallets, smart phones and small electronic devices are particular targets. In Paris, pickpockets are commonly children under the age of 16 because they are difficult to prosecute. Pickpockets are very active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the city center. Travelers may want to consider using a shuttle service or one of the express buses to central Paris rather than the RER. In addition, passengers on metro Line 1, which traverses the city center from east to west and services many major tourist sites, are often targeted. A common method is for one thief to distract the tourist with questions or disturbances, while an accomplice picks pockets, a backpack, or a purse. Schemes in Paris include asking if you would sign a petition or take a survey, and presenting a ring and asking if you dropped it. Thieves often time their pickpocket attempts to coincide with the closing of the automatic doors on the metro, leaving the victim secured on the departing train. Many thefts also occur at the major department stores (e.g., Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, and Le Bon Marché), where tourists may leave wallets, passports, and credit cards on cashier counters during transactions. Popular tourist sites are also popular with thieves, who favor congested areas to mask their activities. The crowded elevators at the Eiffel Tower, escalators at museums such as the Louvre, and the area surrounding Sacré Coeur Basilica in Montmartre are all favored by pickpockets and snatch-and-grab thieves.",
      "There have been some instances of tourists being robbed and assaulted near less utilized metro stations. The area around the Moulin Rouge, known as Pigalle, requires extra security precautions to avoid becoming a victim. Pigalle is an adult entertainment area known for prostitution, sex shows, and illegal drugs. Unsuspecting tourists have run up exorbitant bar bills and been forced to pay before being permitted to leave. Other areas in Paris where extra security precautions are warranted after dark are Les Halles and the Bois de Boulogne.",
      "PROVENCE ALPES MARITIMES (PACA) / LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON (Marseille, Montpellier, Perpignan, Carcassonne Avignon, Aix en Provence, Arles, Cannes, Nice): The PACA/Languedoc-Roussillon region enjoys a fairly low rate of violent crime directed at tourists. The most common problems in the region are thefts from cars (both stopped in traffic and parked) and from luggage trolleys at the major transportation hubs, including the nice airport and railway stations in Marseille, Avignon, and Aix en Provence. Purse snatchings in transportation hubs are also a common problem.",
      "The U.S. Consulate General in Marseille has noted an increase in holiday rental-home burglaries and in necklace snatching. Keep your car doors locked and windows rolled up at all times. Valuables should be hidden out of site to prevent snatch-and-grab attempts. Maintain visual contact with your car when visiting tourist sites, when using rest facilities at gas stations, or stopping to enjoy panoramic views, even for a short period as thieves will break windows to access items left in cars. Victims have reported break-ins within minutes of leaving an unattended car. Keep your passport in a separate location from other valuables.",
      "Organized crime has increased in the south of France—especially in Marseille and Corsica, where feuding groups have been responsible for several recent violent incidents—and although U.S. citizens are not targeted, you should maintain awareness and keep emergency contact information on hand should you find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.",
      "STRASBOURG: Strasbourg's historic center enjoys a fairly low rate of violent crime. Pickpockets and snatch-and-grab thieves tend to concentrate their efforts in the Petite France historic district popular with visitors.",
      "BORDEAUX AND THE AQUITAINE, LIMOUSIN, AND POITOU-CHARENTES REGIONS: Bordeaux and other cities in southwest France are considered fairly safe. In cities and during popular festivals that draw huge crowds, you should be wary of pickpockets and other tourist-aimed crimes, especially near public transportation. Stolen purses, ID cards, and passports left in cars – particularly around renowned landmarks are common.",
      "Note: Swimmers should be careful of strong riptides and swells in the Bordeaux area.",
      "LYON: Although levels of violent crime are low, Lyon has a fair amount of petty crime and vandalism. Late-night weekend rowdiness is common in the center of town and in areas with night clubs. The city’s public transportation system is safe. To combat reckless and drunk drivers and prevent them from fleeing accident scenes, Lyon initiated 30 kilometer-per-hour zones in commercial districts, and the local police have increased controls for drunken driving. Police have also installed speed and red-light radar systems. The number of stolen passports and personal items in the district remains relatively low, and attacks are rare. Home break-ins have increased recently; according to the local news, there are 30-35 per day. Police response to sporadic armed robberies and violence is generally immediate and decisive. A recent wave of armed robberies in luxury goods stores and cash exchange businesses ended with the arrest of an organized gang of delinquents. Bicycle thefts are also a serious risk, as Lyon becomes increasingly bicycle-friendly and more people cycle around town.",
      "NORMANDY: Break-ins and thefts from cars in the parking lots at the Normandy beaches and American cemeteries are common. Do not leave valuables unattended in a car. Locking valuables in the trunk is not an adequate safeguard as thieves often pry open car trunks to steal bags and other valuables.",
      "OVERSEAS (NON-EUROPEAN) FRENCH DEPARTMENTS AND TERRITORIES: Please see the Country Specific Information for French Guiana , French Polynesia , and the French West Indies for crime trends in these areas.",
      "RENNES: In general, the city of Rennes is relatively safe and secure, and crime rates throughout the consular district tend to be lower than in larger cities elsewhere. There are occasional crimes in the center of Rennes related to drunkenness and rowdy behavior, with the largest and most boisterous crowds tending to gather on Thursday nights in the area around Rue Saint Michel (a.k.a. “Rue de la Soif” or “Thirst Street”) and the adjacent Place Sainte Anne. The local authorities make security a priority. Tourists occasionally encounter theft of valuables and passports. Valuables left unattended in rental cars overnight, or for extended amounts of time, are particularly susceptible to theft. In particular, tourist sites around Brittany warn travelers against leaving expensive items in plain view in parked cars due to frequent vehicle break-ins. Do not leave luggage unattended on trains.",
      "TOULOUSE AND THE MIDI-PYRENEES: Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees region are considered generally safe. Car theft, vehicle break-ins, petty theft, and burglary are the most common crimes, and they are relatively more frequent in areas near the railway station. Car-jacking and home invasions may occur, particularly in wealthier areas surrounding Toulouse. Home invasions usually target valuables and cars, but may include violence. Itinerant street people, often in groups accompanied by dogs, are increasingly prevalent in downtown Toulouse, particularly in warmer weather. While alcohol and drug abuse can make them unpredictable, incidents of crime are relatively rare.",
      "Tips on how to avoid becoming a victim: Common-sense security precautions will help you enjoy a trouble-free stay. Most problems can be avoided by being aware of one's surroundings and avoiding high-risk areas.",
      "When going out, carry only essential items: ONE credit/ATM card, ONE piece of identification, and no more than €40-50. Avoid carrying high-value jewelry and large amounts of cash. Valuables should be kept out of sight and in places difficult for thieves to reach, such as internal coat pockets or in pouches hung around the neck or inside clothes. Shoulder bags and wallets in back pockets are an invitation to a thief.",
      "Keep photocopies of travel documents and credit cards separate from the originals, along with key telephone numbers to contact banks for credit card replacement. Raise your awareness level while in crowded elevators, escalators, and metro cars. When possible, take a seat or stand against a wall to deter pickpockets and try to maintain a 360-degree awareness of the surrounding area.",
      "Carry only a purse that zips closed and ensure that it is carried under the arm and slightly in front of the body. Swing backpack-type purses around so that they are slightly in front of your body. Carry your wallet in a front pocket. While on foot, remain aware of your surroundings at all times and keep bags slung across your body and away from the street.",
      "Many U.S. citizens have had purses or bags stolen from the back of a chair or from under the table while in cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs/bars, including higher end establishments. Again, keep your valuables with you and never leave them unattended or out of your sight. Do not leave valuables in hotel rooms. If you must leave valuables in the hotel, consider using the hotel safe.",
      "Thieves often operate in groups and often come to each other's aid if confronted. If a thief is caught in the act, a simple pick-pocketing could turn into an assault (or worse) if you attempt to capture the thief. You can shout out for police assistance to attract attention, but do not pursue the thief.",
      "Do not use ATMs in isolated, poorly lighted areas or where loiterers are present. Be especially alert to persons standing close enough to see the Personal Identification Number (PIN) being entered into the machine. Thieves often conduct successful scams by simply watching the PIN as it is entered and then stealing the card from the user in some other location. If your card gets stuck in an ATM, immediately report the incident to both the local bank and your bank at home.",
      "Many theft and assault victims are targeted when making their way home from a late night out after drinking alcohol. If you go out late at night, do so with a group of friends. There is safety in numbers.",
      "Use only authorized taxis. Authorized taxis in Paris have the following equipment:",
      "An illuminated “Taxi Parisien” sign on the roof; A display meter showing the cost of the trip; A display at the rear of the vehicle and visible from the exterior that enables the monitoring of the daily duration of use of the vehicle; and A plate fixed to the front fender bearing the license number.",

Modern freeways link the cities of Tangier, Rabat, Fez, Casablanca, and Marrakesh. Two-lane highways link other major cities. Secondary routes in rural areas are often narrow and poorly paved. Roads through the Rif and Atlas mountains are steep, narrow, windy, and dangerous. Pedestrians, scooters, and animal-drawn conveyances are common on all roadways, including the freeways, and driving at night should be avoided if possible. During the rainy season (November - March), flash flooding is frequent and sometimes severe, washing away roads and vehicles in rural areas.",

Public transportation is not safe and road conditions in Mauritania are generally poor, particularly in the interior. Overland travel is difficult and roadside assistance is non-existent. The country’s size (larger than Texas and New Mexico combined) and harsh climate make road maintenance and repair especially problematic. Even small amounts of rain can make paved roads in Nouakchott impassable for cars without high clearance. Taxis and public transportation are not considered to be secure forms of transportation for western visitors to Mauritania; U.S. Embassy personnel are directed not to use them.",
      "U.S. citizens traveling overland for long distances in Mauritania should travel in convoys, have suitable four-wheel drive vehicles, a local guide, an adequate supply of water and food, and a second fuel reservoir. Multiple vehicles are recommended in case of breakdown. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and satellite phone are essential when traveling in remote areas. Visitors are urged not to travel alone into the desert or after dark when outside of major urban areas.",
      "Driving in Mauritania can be treacherous; we encourage travelers to hire a trained local driver. Traffic patterns differ considerably from those in the United States and many Mauritanians drive without regard to traffic signs or rules. Roadway obstructions and hazards caused by drifting sand, animals, and poor roads often plague motorists. These hazards, when combined with the number of untrained drivers and poorly maintained vehicles, make heightened caution imperative at all times. Drivers should be extremely vigilant and all vehicle occupants should always wear their seat belts. Motorcycle and bicycle riders should wear helmets and protective clothing. Nighttime driving should be avoided. Traveling after dusk between cities in Mauritania is prohibited for U.S. Embassy staff. All driving outside of the capital of Nouakchott requires a minimum two vehicle convoy.",

The information below concerning Maldives is provided for general reference only, and may vary by location or circumstance. Only a few of the islands are large enough to support automobiles. Most transportation in Maldives is by boat or seaplane (air taxi). Maldives has good safety standards for land, sea and air travel. Roads in Malé and on the airport island are brick and generally well-maintained. Dirt roads on resort islands are well-kept by the resorts. Transportation in Malé is either by foot, by bus, or by readily-available taxis that charge a fixed fee for any single journey. Transportation between the airport and Malé, as well as to nearby resort islands, is by motorized water taxi and speedboat. Trans Maldivian and Maldivian Air Taxi provide charter seaplane service to outlying islands during daylight hours. Maldivian and Fly Me run fixed-wing domestic service to some of the atolls with land runways during night hours as well. Many resorts stop boat transfers between the airport and the resort island after sunset. Visitors to distant resorts arriving in the country at night can expect to stay overnight at a hotel in Malé or at the airport hotel and should confirm transfer arrangements in advance.",

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners and “soft targets” such as restaurants, hotels, recreational events, resorts, beaches, maritime facilities, and aircraft. Since 2010, concerns about a small number of Maldivian extremists, who support violence and are involved with transnational terrorist groups, have increased. For more information, travelers may consult the State Department’s 2015 Country Reports on Terrorism . Maldives has a history of political protests. In 2014, Maldivian police evacuated several tourists to safety from Thulusdhoo Island following conflicts between Maldivians and Israeli tourists. Gangs of young men frequently stage spontaneous protests throughout Malé, often at night. Some of these protests have involved use of anti-Western rhetoric. There are no reports of unrest or demonstrations on the resort islands or at Ibrahim Nasir International Airport. In November 2015, the government declared a State of Emergency. Travelers should not engage in political activity in Maldives. Visitors should exercise caution, particularly at night, and should steer clear of demonstrations and spontaneous gatherings. Those who encounter demonstrations or large crowds should avoid confrontation, remain calm, and depart the area quickly. While traveling in Maldives, travelers should refer to news sources, check the U.S. Embassy Colombo website for possible security updates, and remain aware of their surroundings at all times. U.S. Embassy employees are not resident in Maldives. This will constrain the Embassy’s ability to provide services to U.S. citizens in an emergency. Many tourist resorts are several hours’ distance from Malé by boat, necessitating lengthy response times by authorities in case of medical or criminal emergencies. Crime: Maldives has a moderate crime rate, although crime on resort islands is rare. Theft of valuables left unattended on beaches or in hotels does occur. Drug use is on the rise among young Maldivians and the penalty for drug use is severe.

Demonstrations: Demonstrations are common and occur in all parts of Mexico. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Protesters in Mexico may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares, or take control of toll booths on highways. U.S. citizens are urged to avoid areas of demonstrations, and to exercise caution if in the vicinity of any protests.

      "Road Conditions and Safety: Bottlenecks are common in major cities because infrastructure development has not kept pace with the proliferation of motorized vehicles. Multi-lane highways often merge into narrow two lane roads in the center of town and cause congestion. Many streets are narrow and winding.Traffic is heavy during the morning and afternoon rush hours and slows down considerably when it rains. Monsoonal rains can quickly flood roads located in low-lying areas. Traffic Laws: Traffic in Malaysia moves on the left side of the road, and most vehicles are right-hand drive. By law, you must use your front and back seat belts and must not use your cell phone while driving unless it is hands-free (e.g., Bluetooth). Turning left at a red light is not legal unless otherwise marked. We strongly advise you to carry your passport or Malaysian identification card at all times when driving. Motorcyclists attempt to circumvent traffic blockage by weaving in and out of traffic, temporarily using vacant oncoming traffic lanes, and running through red lights. Use your turn signals well in advance of turning to alert motorcycles of your intent to turn.",

Stay in your car and wait for the police to arrive before exchanging information with other parties involved in the accident. Reports of road rage incidents, especially after midnight, are rising. Avoid confrontational behavior if you are involved in an accident. If you are threatened, leave the scene and file a report with the local police within 24 hours.",
      "Sobriety Checkpoints: Please note that laws against drinking and driving are strictly enforced and carry serious penalties. Police operate sobriety checkpoints in many entertainment districts frequented by expatriates. At these checkpoints, all drivers must submit to alcohol breath tests.

      "Driver’s License Requirements: International Driving Permits (IDP) may be used for 90 days. The IDP must be obtained outside of Malaysia. If you are staying longer than 90 days in Malaysia you will need a local driver’s license. The Malaysian Road Transport Department recommends contacting a local driving school to arrange all the paperwork. In order to obtain a local license, you will also need a valid work permit.",
      "Many car rental agencies in Malaysia are willing to rent vehicles for a short term to U.S. citizens with valid U.S. driver’s licenses. Nevertheless, if you plan to drive in Malaysia, we strongly urge you to obtain an IDP before leaving the United States. More information on how to obtain an IDP is available on the Driving Abroad section of the Department of State website. See our Road Safety page for more information. For more information about Malaysian driver’s licenses, contact the Automobile Association of Malaysia . Also, we suggest that you visit the website of Malaysia’s national tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety .

By regulation, metered fares increase by 50 percent between midnight and 6:00 a.m.; meters are programmed to display the higher fee automatically during these hours. Many individuals prefer to book taxi and car services through widely-used smart phone apps both for convenience and fare transparency.

Driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. Certain white-collar crimes are punishable by caning. You may be prosecuted and sentenced to heavy fines, expulsion and/or imprisonment if you collect local flora or fauna without authorization from the Malaysian government. It is illegal to distribute religious literature of another faith to Malaysian Muslims. Special religious authorities and local police occasionally conduct raids on popular nightspots and hotels to deter activities among local Muslims that contravene religious customs, including drinking alcohol and adultery.",
      "Currency: Currency exchange and Western Union money transfers are readily available. Credit cards are accepted throughout the country, but you should be aware of the risk of fraud. ATMs can be a safer means of obtaining Malaysian Ringgit. PINs in Malaysia are six digits long, and some travelers have reported having difficulty retrieving cash from ATMs using four-digit PINs. Customs : Malaysian authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the import or export of items such as firearms, narcotics, medication, business equipment, currency, books, cultural property or any material which might be considered obscene or harmful to the public interest. Contact the Malaysian Embassy , or one of Malaysia’s consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. Faith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . LGBTI Travelers : Malaysia’s penal code criminalizes homosexual acts, termed “carnal intercourse against the order of nature,” leading to punishment of up to 20 years in prison and/or whipping. Several states in Malaysia have instated Islamic Sharia laws, applying to male and female Muslims, criminalizing same-sex activity with up to three years imprisonment and whipping. Transgender individuals have been arrested and charged with &quot;indecent behavior,” and received fines and prison sentences of up to three months. LGBTI individuals may face discrimination or even violence especially in more conservative rural areas. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: The government does not mandate accessibility to transportation for persons with disabilities, and few older public facilities are adapted for such persons. New government buildings are generally outfitted with a full range of facilities for persons with disabilities. Students : See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers : See our travel tips for Women Travelers . In cases of sexual assault, victims should go directly to the nearest major public hospital which will offer “one-stop” response including medical care and testing, forensic testing, access to the police to make a criminal report, legal assistance, counseling, and temporary shelter."

      "Information from credible sources suggests that there is a continued risk of armed terrorist and criminal groups operating and planning attacks against foreigners, including U.S. citizens, in the East Asian and Pacific region. Since 2014, Malaysian authorities have arrested more than 150 supporters of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist group, including many individuals who planned to fight in Syria and Iraq. U.S. citizens are advised against travel to coastal areas and outlying islands in Eastern Sabah from Kudat to Tawau because of the threat of kidnappings-for-ransom and violence from both terrorist and criminal groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf Group (see the Philippines Travel Warning for more information). In addition to incursions on coastal or resort islands themselves, criminal or terrorist groups may attempt to intercept boats ferrying tourists from the mainland to resort islands. Due to safety concerns, U.S. government employees are prohibited from travelling to most of this area without permission from the Embassy security office and Ambassador. Malaysian law enforcement officials have enacted land and water-based curfews in the coastal areas of Eastern Sabah. Check local media or ask local police for the most recent curfew information if traveling to Eastern Sabah. Public Demonstrations : Local law prohibits non-Malaysians from participating in public protests. While most protests in Malaysia are peaceful, even peaceful demonstrations can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little or no warning. You should avoid areas that may be targeted for demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests or demonstrations.",
      "Crime : Petty theft and violent crime in Kuala Lumpur continue to be concerns. Purse snatching, pick-pocketing, and residential burglaries are the most common crimes committed against foreigners. Criminals frequently target women, alone or with children, for purse snatching. These incidents can occur anytime or anywhere and have also targeted men. Avoid wrapping purse straps around arms or shoulders to avoid injury. Taxi drivers in downtown Kuala Lumpur have perpetrated violent crimes against foreign tourists and local residents. Travelers are advised to book taxis in downtown shopping areas by phone or online, rather than hailing a taxi on the street, particularly after dark. Criminals also target motorists stuck in traffic or stopped at a light with smash and grab robberies. Keep valuables out of sight while driving or remove them from the car (including from the trunk) when parked. GPS devices should not be left on the windshield or dashboard. Scams : U.S. citizens and businesses continue to be frequent victims of internet-based scams originating in Malaysia and have reported millions of dollars in losses. Do not send money to people you have not met in person and who claim to be U.S. citizens in trouble in Malaysia. Resources on how to protect yourself from financial fraud can be found on our International Financial Scams information page. If you become the victim of a scam you may make a formal complaint (in person) to the nearest Malaysian embassy or consulate. You can also report the crime to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) . Credit Card Fraud: Closely safeguard your credit cards at all times and use them only at reputable establishments.

You must have your passport to enter or exit Sabah or Sarawak, even when arriving from peninsular Malaysia on domestic flights. Dual Nationality : Malaysia does not recognize or permit dual nationality. If Malaysian authorities learn that you are a U.S.-Malaysia dual national, they may require you to immediately forfeit your U.S. passport or your Malaysian citizenship. U.S.-Malaysia dual nationals should consider this issue seriously before traveling to Malaysia. See our dual nationality page for more information. U.S.-Israeli Dual Nationals: Immigration officials have denied entry to U.S.-Israeli dual nationals who have presented their Israeli passports to show exit stamps from their last destination.Therefore, it is important that U.S.-Israeli dual nationals use their U.S. passports to depart the last country on their itinerary prior to arriving in Malaysia. Visa Overstays : Malaysian immigration authorities have exit controls at all ports of departure and routinely fine and detain foreigners who overstay their social visit passes (visas). If you overstay your visa, you will not be allowed to exit Malaysia until you resolve the overstay with the Immigration Department of Malaysia . Carry your passport (containing the Malaysian entry stamp) with you at all times in case authorities question your immigration status. Several U.S. citizens have been arrested during immigration sweeps and detentions may last from a few hours to several weeks. Check your visa status periodically while in Malaysia and strictly follow immigration laws and regulations. Visit the Embassy of Malaysia website for the most current visa information.

The information below concerning Niger is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "Road safety throughout Niger is a concern, and visitors are strongly urged to avoid driving at night outside of major cities. The public transportation system, urban and rural road conditions, and the availability of roadside assistance are all poor. The main causes of accidents are driver carelessness, excessive speed, poorly maintained vehicles, and poor to non-existent road surfaces. Other factors include the hazardous mix of bicycles, mopeds, unwary pedestrians, donkey carts, animals (cattle, goats, camels), and buses on roads that are generally unpaved and poorly lit. Overloaded tractor-trailers, “bush taxis,” and disabled vehicles are additional dangers on rural roads, where speeds are generally higher. Travel outside Niamey and other cities often requires four-wheel-drive vehicles, which creates an additional security risk, since these vehicles, especially Toyota Land Cruisers, are high-theft items. Driving at night is always hazardous and should be avoided. Banditry is a continuing problem in northern and eastern Niger, as well as along border areas. There have been occasional car-jackings and highway robberies throughout the country.",
      "While taxis are available at a fixed fare in Niamey, most are in poor condition and do not meet basic U.S. road safety standards. Inter-city “bush-taxis” are available at negotiable fares, but these vehicles (minibuses, station wagons, and sedans) are generally older, unsafe models that are overloaded, poorly maintained, and driven by reckless operators seeking to save time and money. A national bus company (SNTV) operates coaches on inter-city routes and, since being reorganized in 2001, has provided reliable service and experienced no major accidents. Air Transport, Rimbo, and Garba Messagé are private bus companies operating in Niger. There is some concern regarding the youth of drivers and the speed with which the private buses travel the Nigerien roads. The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends against traveling outside of any city at night, as most roads and vehicles do not meet U.S. safety standards, and unlit vehicles, livestock, and pedestrians are common on roads.",

Emergency assistance is also extremely limited. Travelers must carry their own properly labeled supply of prescription drugs and preventative medicines. All travelers are highly encouraged to have travel insurance to cover medical emergencies and the possible need for medical evacuation.",
      "Air quality is poor in Niamey due to dry sandy soil, unpaved roads, and seasonal high winds. Travelers with upper or lower respiratory conditions are cautioned that these health problems may be worsened by environmental factors. Bring ample prescription and over-the-counter medications to address this.",
      "As vaccine preventable illnesses are common in Niger, all routine immunizations recommended by the CDC in the US should be up to date before traveling to Niger.",
      "Extremely high levels of malaria transmission occur in all areas south of the Sahara and in some cities and towns within the desert areas. Plasmodium falciparum , the most dangerous and potentially fatal strain of malaria, is the predominant type found in Niger. Due to the high risk of malaria, the CDC advises that even short-term travelers to Niger take anti malarial drugs. The drugs recommended include: mefloquine (Lariam™), doxycycline, or atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone™). Chloroquine is not effective for most strains of African malaria and should not be used. You should take appropriate anti-malarials with you to Niger as often the drugs sold in local pharmacies are not effective or are counterfeit. The CDC has determined that a traveler who is on an appropriate anti-malarial drug has a greatly reduced chance of contracting the disease. Other personal protective measures, such as the use of insect repellents on the skin and on clothing as well as insecticide treated bed nets markedly reduce the risk of malaria and other insect borne infections such as yellow fever and tick fevers. Complications of malaria can be severe and often fatal. The risk of death or permanent disability associated with malaria infection is far greater than the rare potential side effects of antimalarial medication. Travelers, who become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling in a malaria-risk area, and up to one year after returning home, should seek prompt medical attention and tell the physician their travel history and what anti-malarial drugs they have been taking.",

      "Diarrheal illness is very common among travelers in Niger, even in cities and luxury accommodations. Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through scrupulous washing of hands and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating. The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk (see Food &amp; Water Safety ). Eat only food that is cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only if you have washed them in clean water or peeled them. Drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice (because it may have been made from unclean water). Talk to your doctor about short course antibiotics and loperamide to take with you in case of diarrhea while traveling.",
      "Rabies is not uncommon in Niger and travelers spending more than four weeks, or who anticipate significant animal exposure, should be immunized prior to arrival.

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Niger, you are subject to its laws even if you are a U.S. citizen. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own. For instance, you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you. It is also illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. In some places, driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. These criminal penalties will vary from country to country. There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. For example, you can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you buy pirated goods. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime prosecutable in the United States . If you break local laws in Niger, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not where you are going.",
      "Persons violating Niger's laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Niger are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.",

Tourists should not photograph military or police personnel, or political or student demonstrations, and should seek prior permission before taking a close-up “portrait” photo of an individual.",

Foreign currency exchange over 1 million CFA (about $2,000 at an exchange rate of about 500 CFA/$1) requires authorization from the Ministry of Finance (forms available from all major banks).",

There is extremely limited accessibility to public transportation, road crossings, taxis, restaurants, cafes, bars, and other tourist spots. Most buildings, transportation, and educational facilities do not provide for people with special needs and, because most streets are unpaved, individuals in wheelchairs or who have difficulty walking face challenges.",

      "Travelers to Niger are urged to exercise extreme caution due to the seriousness of the kidnapping threats against Westerners. In 2011, two French citizens were kidnapped by Islamist extremists from a restaurant in Niamey; they were killed by their captors during a rescue attempt while leaving the city. Extremists have kidnapped other Westerners near Niamey as well. U.S. citizens should reduce exposure to locations routinely frequented by Westerners such as restaurants and nightclubs. In an effort to mitigate terror and kidnapping threats, U.S. government employees are permitted to stay only in hotels having an armed Nigerien security presence. The border region with Mali continues to be of specific concern since the Malian government's temporary loss of control over its northern region in early 2012 and the ongoing international military intervention that began in early 2013. The border is porous, and terrorists have attacked several Western-owned facilities in Arlit and Agadez, northern Niger; there are frequent and ongoing reports of terrorists and affiliates crossing into and through Niger. Niger’s southeastern border with Nigeria is also poorly controlled, and Boko Haram has conducted several cross-border attacks into the Diffa and Lake Chad areas of Niger. The Government of Niger has increased its security forces in the border areas, but the situation remains unstable and travel there is not advised. Conditions of insecurity persist in the northwestern areas of Niger, as well as the southern border with Nigeria, and various extremist groups have utilized suicide bombings among other tactics in both areas.",
      "Due to security threats, the U.S. Embassy continues to restrict the travel of U.S. government employees and official visitors in the areas north of Niamey and east of and including Maradi. U.S. government travel to these regions requires armed escort. Travel of U.S. government employees and official visitors outside of Niamey requires coordination with the Regional Security Office and, depending on the specific location, approval by the Ambassador.",
      "Travelers should exercise caution in border areas between Niger and Nigeria in general, but especially when traveling east of Maradi. The Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid travel to the Diffa region due to terrorist activity and kidnappings. Although the U.S. government places the highest priority on the safe recovery of kidnapped U.S. citizens, it is U.S. policy not to make concessions to kidnappers. Consequently, the type of assistance that the U.S. government can provide to kidnapped victims is limited.",
      "As noted in the Department of State’s Worldwide Caution , both the United States and the European Union have designated the Islamist extremist group al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) as a terrorist organization. In November 2013, both Boko Haram and al Murabitun were added to State Department’s list of terrorist organizations (In November 2013, Department of State announced the designation of Nigerian-based Boko Haram and Ansaru as foreign terrorist organizations.) AQIM has declared its intention to attack Western targets throughout the Sahel (including Mali, Mauritania, and Niger), and has claimed responsibility for several terrorist events in Niger, such as prison breaks, suicide attacks and ongoing armed conflict in northern Mali.",
      "For travel in any remote area of the country, the Department of State urges you to use registered guides and to travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones (if possible). Travelers are advised to avoid restricted military areas and to consult local police authorities regarding itinerary and security arrangements.",
      "Avoid street demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Large and small street demonstrations occur frequently in Niger, often near government buildings, university campuses, or other gathering places such as public parks. In January 2015, protests throughout Niger took place, ostensibly in response to the publication in Charlie Hebdo of a cartoon deemed offensive to Muslims and the Nigerien President’s participation in the big Paris rally of support to France after a terrorist attack on the office of Charlie Hebdo. These protests resulted in the burning of numerous churches, bars, and other buildings as well as 10 deaths.",
      "Demonstrations often occur spontaneously. Large student demonstrations typically occur between December and May. You should be particularly vigilant at these times and avoid travel within the city if you hear reports of demonstrations. During previous student demonstrations, rock-throwing demonstrators have targeted non-governmental organization (NGO) and diplomatic vehicles bearing “IT” or “CD” plates. Many past demonstrations have involved rock throwing and tire burning, especially at key intersections in Niamey.",
      "You should maintain security awareness at all times and avoid large public gatherings and street demonstrations. Remember, even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning. While the Embassy endeavors to alert U.S. citizens to demonstrations when possible, due to the spontaneous nature of many street demonstrations it is not possible to inform U.S. citizens each time a demonstration occurs. Additionally, the government of Niger may block SMS, cellphone and social media access in an attempt to control protests, making communication difficult. Local radio and television stations are good sources for information. Security messages issued in connection with demonstrations and strikes will be posted on the Embassy or Consulate’s website separately under a section entitled, “ Safety &amp; Security Messages .”",
      "Note to Non-Governmental Organization Workers: Following the murder of a French tourist in the region of Agadez in 2005, the Government of Niger began requiring not only that NGOs be registered and officially recognized, but also that they inform the Nigerien government of each mission they plan to undertake in Niger. The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends that NGO workers take the following steps to avoid detention and/or expulsion by Nigerien authorities:",

This notice should be in writing and should include the purpose of the mission, the names of the individuals who will be working for the NGO on the mission, the dates of the mission, where the mission will take place, and the types and license plate numbers of the vehicles involved in the mission. The Ministry of the Interior should be copied on this notice of mission.",

Thefts and petty crimes are common day or night. Armed attacks can be committed at any time of day, generally by groups of two to four persons, with one assailant confronting the victim with a weapon while the others provide surveillance or a show of force. Tourists should not walk alone anywhere in Niger, but areas in Niamey around the Gaweye Hotel, the National Museum, on or near the Kennedy Bridge, and the Petit Marché area are of particular concern. These areas are especially prone to muggings. Walking at night is not recommended, as streetlights are scarce and criminals have the protection of darkness to commit their crimes. Recent criminal incidents in Niger have included carjacking, home invasions and muggings. Travelers should keep electronics out of sight, and always keep vehicle doors locked and windows rolled up when stopped at stoplights. Use caution and common sense at all times to avoid thieves and pickpockets.",

There are few working traffic lights or stop signs and few traffic control officers to manage traffic during power outages. The rainy season, generally from May to October, is especially dangerous because of flooded roads and water-concealed potholes.",
      "All drivers and passengers should wear seat belts, lock doors, and keep windows closed. It is important to secure appropriate automobile insurance. Drivers and passengers of vehicles involved in accidents resulting in injury or death have experienced extra-judicial actions, i.e., mob attacks, official consequences such as fines and incarceration, and/or confrontations with the victim's family. Driving between 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. should be done with extreme caution, as bandits and police roadblocks are more numerous at night. Automobiles, trucks, or &quot;okadas&quot; often drive on the wrong side of the road or on sidewalks. These vehicles are difficult to see at night because streets are poorly lit, and many vehicles are missing headlights, tail lights, and reflectors.",
      "Traffic Laws and Culture: Motor vehicle accidents can be reported by dialing “119,” the local equivalent to 911. Traffic control officers may occasionally seek bribes when citing drivers for traffic violations. Excessive speed, unpredictable driving habits, lack of basic maintenance and safety equipment on many vehicles, and the absence of any official vehicle inspection for roadworthiness all present additional hazards. Motorists seldom yield the right-of-way and give little consideration to pedestrians and cyclists. Accidents on highways with high casualties are common. Chronic fuel shortages have led to long lines at service stations, which disrupt or block traffic for extended periods.",
      "Public Transportation : We recommend avoiding public transportation throughout Nigeria. Public transportation vehicles, such as buses and motorbikes, are unsafe due to poor maintenance, high speeds, and overcrowding. Motorbike taxis, known in Nigeria as &quot;okadas,&quot; offer a common form of public transportation in many cities and pose serious danger to other motorists, their own passengers, and pedestrians. Motorbikes are banned within Abuja's city limits and many major thoroughfares in Lagos. Okada drivers and passengers are required to wear helmets in a number of cities in the country; police can fine violators on the spot. Passengers in local taxis have been driven to secluded locations where they were attacked and robbed. Several of the victims required hospitalization.",

      "Road Conditions and Safety: U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions significantly worse than those found in the United States. The information below is provided for general reference and may not apply in every situation.",
      "Nighttime Travel: You should avoid nighttime road travel should outside the Kathmandu Valley and minimize nighttime travel within Kathmandu because of insufficient street lighting and hazardous road conditions.",
      "In Nepal, vehicles are driven on the left-hand side of the road. Travel via road in areas outside the Kathmandu Valley can be dangerous. In general, roads in Nepal are in poor condition and lack basic safety features, resulting in significant numbers of accidents and fatalities.",
      "Motorcycle Travel: Deaths from motorcycle accidents have risen dramatically in recent years, and U.S. citizens should consider avoiding riding motorcycles in Nepal, particularly on highways.",
      "Buses: It is dangerous to travel on the roofs of buses as live electrical and other communications wires hang low in many places. Traffic police also impose fines and detain individuals for riding on the roofs of buses. Long-distance buses often drive recklessly, and bus accidents involving multiple fatalities are not uncommon.",
      "Taxis: Visitors throughout Nepal, including in Kathmandu, are encouraged to use metered taxis and avoid public buses and microbuses. Many taxi drivers will refuse to use the meter, insisting on negotiating the price instead. In addition, there have been instances of taxi drivers tampering with the meters in an attempt to charge higher than normal fares. If you believe that you are being overcharged, you may wish to file a complaint with the traffic police on the street or at the nearest local police station.",
      "Traffic: In the Kathmandu Valley, traffic jams are common on major streets. Traffic is poorly regulated, and the volume of vehicles on the roads is increasing faster than improvements in infrastructure. Many drivers are neither properly licensed nor trained, vehicles are poorly maintained, and public vehicles are often overloaded.",
      "Pedestrian Travel: Sidewalks are nonexistent in many areas, and drivers generally do not yield the right-of-way to pedestrians. Pedestrians account for a considerable portion of traffic fatalities in Nepal.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the website of Nepal’s national tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety.",
      "Aviation Safety and Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Nepal, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Nepal’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page .",
      "Domestic air safety continues to be of concern. In recent years, there have been a number of fatal plane crashes on domestic routes in Nepal, including some in which U.S. citizens have been killed. The incidence of such crashes is not concentrated with one carrier, but rather has occurred among various domestic carriers. As a result of Nepal’s poor aviation safety record, in December 2013 the European Union (EU) banned all Nepali airlines from flying into or within EU countries. Although Nepali domestic flights are insured, payments to the families of victims of a plane crash are minimal compared to what would normally be paid in the United States. Domestic air travelers may want to consider flight insurance that will cover domestic flights in Nepal before leaving home."

    "health": [
      "General: Medical care in Nepal is limited and generally not up to Western standards. Some routine medical complaints can be addressed by clinics in Kathmandu and basic emergency surgeries can be performed in the capital. Serious illnesses, however, often require evacuation to the nearest adequate medical facility in a neighboring country. Serious illnesses and injuries suffered while hiking in remote areas may require evacuation by helicopter to Kathmandu. Those trekking in remote areas of Nepal should factor the high cost of a potential helicopter rescue into their financial considerations. It is a good idea for travelers to purchase medical evacuation insurance as medical evacuations can cost tens of thousands of dollars and payment will be expected in cash before the medevac can take place, if there is no insurance coverage. There is minimal mental health care available in Nepal. U.S. citizens with mental health problems are generally stabilized and transported to the United States or to another regional center for care. The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu maintains a list of local medical facilities and practitioners .",
      "Medical facilities are often overwhelmed because of insufficient resources. Emergency medical services, especially in public hospitals, are of poor quality compared to that available in the United States. Food hygiene and sanitary food handling practices are uncommon in Nepal and precautions should be taken to prevent water and food-borne illnesses.",
      "Malaria, and intestinal tract diseases, including cholera, are present in the Terai region.",

      "Arrests and Consequences: If you break local laws in Nepal, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. If you are arrested in Nepal, during the investigation phase, the authorities may keep you in detention for weeks or even longer if a court so orders. Punishment for violations of criminal laws in Nepal range from fines to imprisonment, depending on the crime.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:",
      "Trekking – TIMS Card: The Government of Nepal has authorized the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) to implement a system for foreign hikers called the Trekkers’ Information Management System (TIMS). Foreign visitors on hiking trips in Nepal, including those not with organized hiking groups, are required to have a valid TIMS card issued by TAAN, its member agencies, or NTB. In case of an emergency, this system helps authorities ascertain the whereabouts of trekkers. TIMS cards cost the Nepali rupees equivalent of 20 USD (if applying individually) or the Nepali rupees equivalent of 10 USD (if applying in a group) through authorized trekking companies, the TAAN office in Kathmandu or Pokhara, and the NTB office. Local agencies that organize treks often will facilitate obtaining your TIMS card. Solo Trekking: The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu strongly recommends that U.S. citizens not hike alone, nor become separated from larger traveling parties while on a trail. Solo trekking can be dangerous, and the lack of available immediate assistance has contributed to injuries and death. Lone trekkers are likely more vulnerable to criminals. Nepali authorities are considering a ban on solo or independent trekking because of safety concerns. If a ban is implemented, all trekkers would be required to use approved guides and/or porters hired through authorized trekking agencies. Consideration of this policy comes in response to incidents over recent years in which a number of foreign visitors (including U.S. citizens) have been attacked or seriously injured while trekking alone on popular trails. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, have also gone missing while trekking alone. Extensive search efforts are not always successful in tracing the trekkers’ whereabouts.",
      "The safest option for trekkers is to join an organized group and/or use a reputable trekking company that provides an experienced guide and porters who communicate in both Nepali and English.",
      "U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to contact the Embassy in Kathmandu for the latest security information and to register their itinerary before undertaking treks outside the Kathmandu Valley. Trekkers are also advised to leave their itinerary with family or friends in the United States and to check in at police checkpoints where trekking permits are logged.",
      "Trekking: Natural Disaster Risks: Damage to telephone services in trekking areas caused by floods and landslides during the monsoon season complicates efforts to locate U.S. citizens and make arrangements for medical evacuations. Trekking in Nepal involves walking over rugged, steep terrain where one is exposed to the elements, often at high altitudes. Many popular trekking routes in Nepal cross passes as high as 18,000 feet.",
      "Trekkers should also be alert to the possibility of avalanches, landslides, and falling rocks, even when trails are clear. These risks existed prior to the April 25, 2015 earthquake and its aftershocks, which have further destabilized some steep, mountainous areas, causing severe landslides in some affected areas. Monsoon rains, which generally begin in June and largely end in September, may in any year destabilize steep slopes and mountainsides. Although trekking permits are being issued, not all trekking areas are safe for travel. We encourage travelers to consult carefully with their travel and trekking agencies for current, location-specific information and to heed warnings of potential danger. These conditions affect the possibility of emergency assistance if needed. We recommend providing family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to trekking. Do not trek alone.",
      "Trekking: Altitude Risks: The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu strongly recommends that U.S. citizens exercise caution when trekking at high altitudes. Acclimatization is better achieved by walking slowly, rather than hurrying to cover the distance at high altitudes. Without acclimatization, any trekker who flies directly from a low elevation to a high elevation runs the risk of suffering from debilitating altitude sickness. Only experienced mountain climbers should tackle the Himalayas. Trekkers of all ages, experience, and fitness levels can experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), which can be deadly. Trekking: Special Requirements: Trekking in certain remote areas of Nepal and in national parks may require additional permits or fees. Travelers may consult with an experienced tour agency, or consult the website of the Nepali Department of Immigration for more information.",
      "Trekking: Lodging and Travel: During peak trekking seasons (generally autumn and spring), hotel rooms may become scarce. U.S. citizens are advised to make advance booking for hotel rooms and be aware of possible flight/airport delays. Domestic air flight cancellations and delays occur frequently because of bad weather, including to and from Lukla (gateway to the Everest Base Camp trek) and Jumla (gateway to treks to the Mustang region). Travelers should leave ample time to catch their outbound international flights if they plan to connect from domestic flights. U.S. citizens should be aware that many hotels in Nepal do not meet international fire or earthquake safety standards.",
      "Before leaving Kathmandu, trekkers can check with the Himalayan Rescue Association (phone: +977-1-444-0292/444-0293) or the U.S. Embassy for reliable information about trail conditions and potential hazards of traveling in the Himalayas.",
      "Other Outdoor Activities: Several tourists have drowned while swimming in Phewa Lake and adjoining lakes in Pokhara because of flash floods triggered by monsoon rains or after becoming entangled in submerged tree branches or roots. Incidents of boats capsizing on the choppy water of the lakes have also occurred. Visitors should wear life jackets. Paragliding and ultralight aircraft tourism have become popular in Pokhara, and many new companies offer such services in Pokhara. U.S. citizens should weigh the risks involved with paragliding and ultralight aircraft travel. There are also a number of deep and dangerous ravines not clearly visible to pedestrians in Pokhara city, mainly in the outlying areas. Some local residents and foreigners have fallen into these ravines and sustained serious injuries or died. Volunteering: A number of Nepal-based organizations maintain websites offering volunteer opportunities. The Embassy has received reports that many – if not most – such opportunities, especially those involving volunteering at orphanages or “children’s homes,” are not charities. Instead, they are profit-making enterprises set up to attract donations from abroad and financial support from volunteers. Many of the children are not orphans, and volunteering at such an organization indirectly contributes to child exploitation. An organization’s bona fides can be confirmed by contacting the Nepali Central Child Welfare Board (CCWB), attention Namuna Bhusal (tel. +977-9851139474 or e-mail namuna@ccwb.gov.np ).",
      "Currency: Nepal has a controlled or fixed currency exchange rate under which the Nepalese Rupee is pegged to the Indian Rupee. The Government of Nepal requires travelers to declare either the import or export of currency that exceeds 5,000 USD in value by filling out a customs declaration form. Travelers may also face difficulties if traveling with a large quantity of valuables, such as gold and jewelry. Carrying more than 50 grams of gold or 500 grams of silver may result in arrest at a port of entry. The Embassy is not aware of any banks or money exchange offices in Nepal that accept U.S.-issued travelers checks. Accordingly, travelers should consider alternative methods of accessing local currency (e.g., exchanging cash U.S. dollars for Nepali rupees at a bank or money exchange office, or withdrawing rupees from an ATM). The Nepalese Department of Customs has reported an increased number of foreigners arrested for currency violations – generally for bringing in cash in excess of 5,000 USD without making a formal declaration. Travelers should ensure that they keep a copy of the declaration form after customs officials have put the official endorsement and appropriate stamps on the form to prevent any problems upon departure.",
      "Please note that this requirement is subject to change and travelers should contact the Embassy of Nepal in Washington, D.C. to obtain the latest information. Consequences for violating this requirement generally include seizure of all cash, gold, or jewelry carried, as well as fines and imprisonment. It is illegal to possess 500 or 1,000 Indian Rupee notes in Nepal. Accordingly, travelers coming to Nepal from India who hope to change Indian currency into Nepali Rupees are advised to bring 100 Indian Rupee notes or lower denominations only.",
      "Dual Nationality : Nepal does not recognize dual nationality. Accordingly, when a Nepali citizen naturalizes as a U.S. citizen, he/she loses his/her Nepali citizenship. Some travelers who have tried to maintain both U.S. and Nepali passports have faced difficulties entering or exiting Nepal. U.S. citizens of Nepali descent may be eligible for a special visa called a “Non-Resident Nepali” or “NRN” Identity Card. The NRN Identity Card allows a holder to open a local bank account, invest, and own certain types of property, subject to certain restrictions. For more information, contact the Nepali Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Embassy of Nepal in the United States. Customs: Nepal customs regulations are complex. Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning importation (even temporary importation) into Nepal and exportation from Nepal of items such as:",
      "valuable metals articles of archaeological and religious importance wildlife and related articles drugs arms and ammunition communications equipment.",
      "Items purported to be for donation to schools, hospitals, and other social organizations have sometimes been confiscated, or cleared only after payment of a significant fine for failure to obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Finance . Those wishing to donate items to a charity or any organization in Nepal must obtain prior approval for waiver of the custom fees from the Ministry of Finance by sending a formal request letter (not via email) to the following address:",
      "Revenue Secretary Ministry of Finance Singha Durbar Kathmandu, Nepal Tel: +977-1-4211400 Fax: +977-1-4211605 The request should include detailed information about the items to be imported, as well as the organizations receiving the donations. The Revenue Secretary will review the request and refer it to the Ministerial level for final decision and approval. Note that all requests are processed on a case-by-case basis. It is highly recommended that intended recipient(s) coordinate with the Ministry to get requests processed. Please see our Customs Information . Natural Disasters: Nepal lies on an active fault zone and is still considered at high-risk for a major earthquake, as demonstrated by the major April 25, 2015 earthquake and significant aftershocks that caused extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley and many districts of Nepal. Lack of adequate emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities, combined with building codes that are not strictly enforced, multiply the extent of possible catastrophic damage from a major earthquake, especially in the Kathmandu Valley. Nepal is also prone to flooding and landslides. The Government of Nepal’s ability to respond in the event of a natural disaster may be limited. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and an Embassy Emergency Preparedness Guide is also available online.",

Nepal, however, remains a conservative and traditional society. Discrimination exists and there have been reports of non-violent harassment of LGBTI persons. Accordingly, LGBTI travelers may wish to be discreet and avoid public displays of affection. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.",
      "Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance : While in Nepal, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation difficult. Nepali law prohibits discrimination against persons who have physical and mental disabilities, including discrimination in employment, education, access to health care, and in the provision of other state services. The law mandates access to buildings, transportation, employment, education, and other state services, but these provisions generally are not enforced. Nepal’s poor infrastructure makes it impracticable in many cases for a mobility-impaired traveler to move around the country, including within the Kathmandu Valley. The government is largely ineffective in implementing or enforcing laws regarding persons with disabilities. Except for a few clinics and hospitals, Nepal mostly lacks accessible and appropriate accommodation for individuals with disabilities.",

      "Renting a car or a camper is a popular way to enjoy New Zealand's natural beauty, but if you are unfamiliar with local conditions, you should be extremely careful. New Zealand has only 100 miles of multi-lane divided motorways. Most intercity travel is on narrow, two-lane roads. While these roads are in good condition, New Zealand's rugged terrain means motorists often encounter sharper curves and steeper grades than those found on the U.S. Interstate Highway System. You should also use caution to avoid animals when driving in rural areas. There is very limited cell phone coverage on large portions of scenic highway in the South Island, which is remote and has little traffic. Pedestrians do not have the right of way except in crosswalks. New Zealand law requires that cars stop for pedestrians who are in a crosswalk and that cars stop at least two meters (approximately 6 feet) from a crosswalk that is in use.",
      "Traffic Laws",
      "All traffic travels on the left in New Zealand, and you should exercise extra caution if you are accustomed to driving on the right. Driving on the wrong side of the road is a leading cause of serious injury and death for U.S. tourists. Make sure to follow the posted speed limit signs. The speed limits are much lower than they are in the United States. Proceed carefully through intersections. Traffic circles are common throughout New Zealand. When approaching a traffic circle, always yield to traffic coming from the right--noting that traffic already in the circle has the right-of-way--and merge to the left into the circle. Left turns on a red traffic signal are not permitted. New Zealand prohibits driving while texting as well as driving while using a cell phone.",

There are very few paved roads in South Sudan; most roads are narrow, rutted, and poorly maintained. Local drivers often do not observe conventions for the right-of-way, stop on the road without warning, and frequently exceed safe speeds for road, traffic, and weather conditions. Driving at night can be dangerous because of the lack of street lights throughout the country.",

Travelers can diminish diarrhea risk through scrupulous washing of hands and use of hand sanitizers, especially before food preparation and eating. The greatest risk of traveler’s diarrhea is from contaminated food. Choose foods and beverages carefully to lower your risk, and drink only beverages from factory-sealed containers, and avoid ice (because it may have been made from unclean water).",

      "Schistosomiasis is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread by fresh water snails particularly along tributaries of the Nile. The larval stage of the worm can burrow through your skin when in contact with contaminated fresh water. Avoid wading, swimming, bathing, or washing in, and drinking from, bodies of fresh water such as canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs. If you do come into contact with water that might contain schistosomiasis, it is recommended that you seek a test from your medical provider as symptoms can take months to years to appear.",

The Ministry of Health has issued recommendations that travelers who have been in an ebola-affected country in the past 21 days should not enter South Sudan until the end of the 21 days incubation period.",

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in South Sudan, you are subject to its laws. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own. You may be questioned or detained by police if you do not have your passport with you. South Sudan’s security services commit arbitrary arrests and often detain foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens. The country’s legal system is rudimentary and sometimes ineffective. U.S. citizens may have little recourse to justice should they be detained and legal proceedings can be lengthy and seemingly subjective. Contractual and other business disputes with local partners may not be resolved in a manner that is consistent with international practices and judicial fairness. Security forces often operate outside civilian control, and do not always follow laws governing due process and treatment of detainees.",
      "If you break local laws in South Sudan, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It is very important to know what is legal and what is not while you are in South Sudan. Penalties for breaking the law may be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating South Sudan’s laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.",
      "There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",
      "Based on the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, bilateral agreements with certain countries, and international law, if you are arrested in South Sudan, you have the option to request that the police, prison officials, or other authorities alert the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate of your arrest, and to have communications from you forwarded to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas. That said, security officials rarely contact the U.S. Embassy in Juba when U.S. citizens are detained.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: South Sudan is currently experiencing an internal conflict affecting several parts of the country. This has further diminished the government’s already limited capabilities. If you are traveling or doing business in South Sudan, you may find it difficult to identify legal or administrative remedies if problems arise. We often do not get timely notification of the detention of U.S. citizens in South Sudan.",

Societal discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons is widespread, and there are no known LGBT organizations.

      "Driving conditions in Peru are very different from those found in the United States and can be considerably more dangerous. Visitors are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with local law and driving customs before attempting to operate vehicles. Road travel at night is extremely dangerous due to poor road markings and frequent unmarked road hazards. Drivers should not travel alone on rural roads, even in daylight. Convoy travel is preferable. Spare tires, parts, and fuel are needed when traveling in remote areas, where distances between service areas are great. Fog is common on coastal and mountain highways, and the resulting poor visibility frequently causes accidents. Inter-city bus travel is dangerous. Armed robbers, who force passengers off buses and steal their belongings, sometimes hold up inter-city buses at night. Bus accidents resulting in multiple deaths and injuries are common, and they are frequently attributed to excessive speed, poor bus maintenance, and driver fatigue. Because of these safety concerns, the U.S. Peace Corps in Peru restricts Peace Corps volunteers’ use of overnight inter-city buses and requires Peace Corps volunteers who make inter-city bus trips to use certain bus lines with good safety records. Current approved lines are Cruz del Sur, Linea, Movil Tours, CIAL, OLTURSA, Ormeño, TEPSA, and ITTSA. The Peruvian Ministry of Transportation also publishes a list in Spanish of the intercity bus companies with the highest rates of traffic accidents resulting in fatalities and serious injuries. For further information, travelers may contact their nearest automobile club, or (for information in Spanish) the Associacion Automotriz del Peru , 299 Avenida Dos de Mayo, San Isidro, Lima 27, Peru, telephone 51-1-440-0495.",

Urban private health care facilities are often better staffed and equipped than public or rural ones. Public hospital facilities in Cusco, the prime tourist destination, are generally inadequate to handle serious medical conditions. Although some private hospital facilities in Cusco may be able to treat acute medical problems, in general the seriously ill traveler should return to Lima for further care as soon as is medically feasible.",
      "Visitors to high-altitude Andean destinations, such as Cusco (11,000 feet), Machu Picchu (8,000 feet), or Lake Titicaca (13,000 feet) should discuss the trip with their personal physician prior to departing the United States. Travel to high altitudes could pose a serious risk of illness, hospitalization, and even death, particularly if the traveler has a medical condition that affects blood circulation or breathing. Several U.S. citizens have died in Peru from medical conditions exacerbated by altitude. Tourists or business visitors, particularly those who suffer from cardiac-related problems or high blood pressure, who wish to travel to high-altitude areas in Peru, should undergo a medical examination before traveling. New arrivals, even healthy and fit persons, will feel symptoms of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) at high-altitude, and most will need time to adjust to the altitude. Most people will have increased respiration and heart rate. Many will have headaches, difficulty sleeping, lack of appetite, minor gastric and intestinal upsets, and mood changes. To help prevent these complications, consult your personal physician, avoid alcohol and smoking for at least one week after arrival at high altitudes, and limit physical activity for the first 36 to 48 hours after arrival at high altitudes.",
      "In jungle areas east of the Andes mountain range (cordillera), chloroquine-resistant malaria is a serious problem. Travelers are advised to check the CDC Website to determine if they are going to a malarious area in Peru. Most tourist destinations such as Lima, Cusco, Macchu Picchu, Arequipa and Lake Titicaca do not have malaria, but many areas in rainforest destinations in Loreto, Madre deDios and other provinces east of the Andes have malaria risk. Cholera, yellow fever, hepatitis, dengue fever, and other exotic and contagious diseases are also present. To prevent insect borne illness such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and other illnesses, travelers should carry and use insect repellents containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535. Treating clothing and tents with permethrin and sleeping in screened or air conditioned rooms under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets will help diminish bites from mosquitoes as well ticks, fleas, chiggers, etc., some of which may also carry infections. Yellow fever is endemic in certain areas of Peru; in general, those areas are located on the eastern side of the cordillera and at lower elevations in jungle areas. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Peruvian government recommend that travelers to Peru, who are over 9 months of age, receive a yellow fever vaccination and carry documentation of the vaccination with them on their trip. Zika Virus: Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact. The CDC has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects in some fetuses and babies born to infected mothers. For additional information about Zika, including travel advisories, visit the CDC website . Diarrheal illness caused by contaminated food or water is very common in Peru and is potentially serious. If suffering from persistent symptoms, seek medical attention. Local tap water in Peru is not considered potable. Only bottled or treated (disinfected) water should be used for drinking. Fruits and vegetables should be washed and/or disinfected with care, and meats and fish should be thoroughly cooked.

Be cautious in relying on those with a commercial interest in gauging conditions. Companies offering white-water rafting in Peru, their guides, and their equipment may not be held to the same standards as similar companies in the United States.

Peruvian law also provides for the protection, care, rehabilitation, security, and social inclusion of persons with disabilities, and mandates that public spaces be free of barriers and accessible to persons with disabilities. However, the government of Peru has devoted limited resources to enforcement and training, and little effort has been made to ensure access to public buildings and areas.",

Sporadic incidents of Shining Path violence, mainly against Peruvian security services, have occurred in the recent past in rural provinces within the Regions of Ayacucho, Cusco, Huancavelica, Huánuco, and Junín. Incidents have included attacks by large, heavily armed groups of Shining Path on Peruvian army and police patrols in remote areas, as well as kidnappings of Peruvian and foreign workers. Local community self-defense groups (“rondas campesinas”) may operate legally in some rural areas with minimal police presence; visitors are encouraged to cooperate with the rondas’ directions. Mining prospectors, adventure travelers, and others considering travel to remote areas of Peru are strongly advised to contact the U.S. Embassy in Lima for current security information.",

      "CRIME: Approximately 400,000 trips are made by U.S. citizens through Peru each year. A small but growing number of U.S. travelers have been victims of serious crimes. The information below is intended to raise awareness of the potential for crime and suggest measures visitors can take to avoid becoming a victim.",
      "VIOLENT CRIME: Violent crime, including carjacking, assault, sexual assault, and armed robbery is common in Lima and other large cities. The Embassy is aware of reports of women being sexually assaulted in their place of lodging, or after their drinks were drugged while visiting bars or nightclubs. Women travelling alone should be especially careful to avoid situations in which they are vulnerable due to impaired judgment or isolation. Resistance to attempted robberies often provokes greater violence, while victims who do not resist usually do not suffer serious physical harm. &quot;Express kidnappings,&quot; in which criminals kidnap victims and seek to obtain funds from their bank accounts via automatic teller machines, occur frequently.",
      "In the recent past, there have been a number of cases of armed robbery, rape, other sexual assault, and attempted rape of U.S. citizens and other foreign tourists in Arequipa and in Cusco city, as well as in the outlying areas in the vicinity of various Incan ruins. These assaults have occurred both during daylight hours and at night.",
      "Taxis and road crime: Passengers who hail taxis on the street have been assaulted and robbed. Street taxis are not well regulated and are often used as a front by criminals to rob unsuspecting victims. The Embassy’s Regional Security Officer recommends that all Embassy personnel use telephone-dispatched radio taxis or car services associated with major hotels and not hail taxis on the street.",
      "Some crimes in the city of Cusco and in Arequipa have involved the drivers of rogue (or unregistered) taxis. Travelers should use only licensed, registered taxis such as those available from taxi stands in Cusco displaying a blue decal issued by the municipal government on the windshield of the vehicle. Visitors should not accept offers of transportation or guide services from individuals seeking clients on the streets. In the city of Arequipa, express kidnappings have become such a problem that all U.S. government personnel are prohibited from hailing taxis off the street. U.S. government personnel there must use cabs from well-established dispatch taxi companies. The Embassy’s Regional Security Officer recommends that all U.S. citizens visiting Arequipa also use dispatch taxi companies. In recent years there have been several reports of U.S. citizens falling victim to so-called “express kidnappings” in Arequipa after taking taxis hailed on the street. On occasion, the victim was bound, beaten, and held for over 24 hours as the assailants attempted to empty cash from bank accounts with the victim’s stolen ATM card.",
      "Theft: Travelers should be particularly careful when arriving at Lima’s Jorge Chavez International Airport. Travelers should guard against the theft of luggage and other belongings, and particularly U.S. passports. Bogus taxi drivers and thieves pretending to be tour operators sometimes approach arriving passengers. Additionally, arriving tourists may be targeted on main roads leaving the airport. Thieves sometimes smash windows at traffic lights to steal bags out of passenger seats, so it is best to store bags in the trunk of the car.",
      "If possible, pre-arrange your airport pick-up with your hotel or tour operator and ask for the name of the person meeting you. If you must take a taxi, use one of the reservation desks located in the airport arrival hall; contact details are available through Lima Airport Partners Always ask your transportation provider whether security window film is installed in the vehicle, as added protection against “smash-and-grab” types of crime.",
      "Travelers should not leave any valuables in sight or unattended in parked vehicles as these become inviting targets for thieves. Visitors should also ensure they secure purses and other personal belongings when in cafés and restaurants as street criminals are adept at surreptitiously removing items of value from purses or clothing slung over chairs.",
      "Street crime: Thieves often smash car windows at traffic lights to grab jewelry, purses, backpacks, or other visible items from a car. This type of assault is very common on main roads leading to and from Lima's Jorge Chavez International Airport, specifically along De la Marina and Faucett Avenues and Via de Evitamiento, but it can occur anywhere in congested traffic, particularly in downtown Lima. Travelers are encouraged to put all belongings, including purses, in the trunk of a car or taxi.",
      "The threat of street crime is greatest in areas that attract large crowds, particularly crowds of tourists or wealthy Peruvians. A crowd allows a thief (or thieves, since petty thieves often operate in a group) the opportunity to select and approach the potential victim without attracting attention. Visitors should be especially careful when visiting tourist areas in Lima such as the Plaza de Armas (Government Square), the Plaza San Martin, Acho Bullring, Pachacamac, and any location in downtown Lima. Additionally, visitors to municipal markets as well as the Gamarra textile district of La Victoria should be extremely cautious. Street crime is also prevalent in cities in Peru's interior, including Cusco, Arequipa, Puno, and Juliaca. U.S. citizens traveling alone or in unescorted groups are more vulnerable to street crime.",
      "Visitors are advised to keep cash and identification in their front pockets and to limit their cash on hand and unnecessary credit cards. Replacing items such as credit cards, U.S. driver’s licenses, and other identification while in Peru can be difficult and time-consuming. Handbags should not be carried, but if they are, they should be tucked into the crook of an arm or, if carrying a bag with a shoulder strap, do not allow the bag to hang freely, but keep a hand over the clasp. It is generally recommended that all jewelry be removed prior to going to a market or other crowded areas.",
      "Visitors are advised not to carry their U.S. passports if they are not needed. If the police request identification, a copy of the passport is acceptable. A copy of the data page, the page with the Peruvian visa, and a copy of the page with the Peruvian entry stamp should be carried.",
      "Tourists should be particularly cautious when visiting the Sacsayhuaman ruins outside Cusco. They should not travel alone, but rather in as large a group as possible. Visitors should also avoid these areas at dawn, dusk, or nighttime, since roving gangs are known to frequent these areas and prey on unsuspecting tourists. There have also been reports of tourists hiking near the ruins of Choquequirao being robbed by armed men who may be affiliated with politically motivated terrorist groups. U.S. citizen backpackers have also been victims of armed robbery while hiking on trails other than the Inca Trail.",
      "Crime also occurs on roads, particularly at night and outside urban areas. Clandestine, impromptu roadblocks can appear on even major highways, where bus and automobile passengers are robbed. The risk is even greater on rural roads after dark. In addition, numerous U.S. citizens have reported the theft of passports, cameras, and other valuables on overnight bus rides, by thieves who take advantage of sleeping passengers or their stowed luggage in the cargo area underneath when opened during scheduled stops for passengers to disembark or enter the bus.",
      "Fraud: Counterfeit U.S. currency is a growing and serious problem in Peru. In many areas of Lima, moneychangers openly change money on the street. These individuals should be avoided as they are a conduit for counterfeit currency, and in many cases, work together with pickpockets by pointing out potential victims. In addition, these individuals have frequently been the victims of violent robberies in which bystanders have been injured. There have also been several reported incidents of counterfeit currency being paid out as winnings by casinos, though the Embassy has not received reports of this happening at larger, well-known casinos.",
      "Incidents of credit card fraud are on the rise, particularly the electronic “skimming” of credit card data. Travelers should keep their credit cards within their sight while making transactions.",
      "Don't buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, you may also be breaking local law.",
      "One increasingly common extortion technique is known as the “grandparent scam.” It involves calls placed by persons alleging to be attorneys, local law enforcement or U.S. government employees claiming that a person’s relative—nearly always a grandchild—has been in a car accident (or other ruse) in Peru and has been arrested/detained. Often the caller will put another person on the line purporting to be the grandchild, who claims he doesn’t sound like himself because he has a cold or has been crying. The caller asks for a large sum of money to be sent by Western Union to ensure the subject’s release and admonishes the relative not to speak to any other family members. If you receive a call like this, BEFORE YOU SEND ANY MONEY, contact family members to confirm the actual whereabouts of the supposedly detained grandchild. If it turns out he or she might actually have traveled to Peru, contact the State Department's Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 1-888-407-4747 or the U.S. Embassy in Lima for assistance.

Travelers entering Peru on a U.S. passport receive a card and an entry stamp from Peruvian Immigration upon arrival stating the length of approved stay (usually 90 days). Extensions are not available, and overstays will result in fines. Visit the Embassy of Peru website for the most current visa information. Peru does not require any immunizations for entry, although it recommends vaccination against Yellow Fever. The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Peru.",
      "It is imperative that all travelers entering Peru – especially those crossing at a land border – obtain an entry stamp from Peruvian immigration authorities at the time and place of entry. Travelers without an entry stamp will not be allowed to exit the country. Immigration authorities often insist that travelers must return to the point of entry in order to obtain the stamp (e.g., a traveler who crossed into Peru by land from Bolivia will not be provided an entry stamp by immigration authorities in Lima, but will have to return to the original border-crossing point to obtain it). The U.S. Embassy cannot supply official letters legitimating a traveler’s claims about how and when s/he entered Peru for the purpose of obtaining an entry record.",
      "In cases of passports that have been lost or stolen in Peru, travelers must first obtain a new passport and then “transfer” the entry record from their previous passport to the new one before they are allowed to exit the country.

España 730, Breña, Lima, open weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., in order to pay for and process the transfer.

In the United States, the non-travelling parent/guardian(s) should visit the nearest Peruvian Consulate and complete a “Permiso Notarial de Viaje.” Please be aware that these authorizations are valid for 30 days and one trip only. If the minor child has only one legal parent or guardian, the travelling parent/guardian must present evidence of sole custody, as well as a completed Permiso Notarial de Viaje from a Peruvian notary.",

Peruvian customs authorities may retain articles lacking such documentation and forward them to INC for evaluation. If found to be reproductions, the objects eventually may be returned to the purchaser, but only after the purchaser pays all storage and shipping charges.",

      "Road Conditions and Safety : While in Pakistan, you will encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below about Pakistan is provided for general reference only, and it might vary in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "Traffic Laws : Traffic in Pakistan moves on the left; the opposite of U.S. traffic. Roads are crowded, drivers are often aggressive and poorly trained, and many vehicles, particularly large trucks and buses, are badly maintained. Local drivers are willing to drive head-on in your lane of traffic if they believe it helps them get to their destination more rapidly. Animals, horse carts, bicyclists, and pedestrians can pose roadside hazards in some areas. Roads, including most major highways, also suffer from poor maintenance and often have numerous potholes, sharp drop-offs, and barriers that are not sign-posted. Drivers should exercise extreme caution when traveling at night by road, since many vehicles do not have working headlights or dimmers, and many roads are not illuminated or signed. We recommend against driving without experienced local drivers or guides.",
      "Public Transportation: Avoid all trains, taxis, and other forms of public transportation. For security reasons, U.S. Government personnel are prohibited from using all forms of public transportation. See the Safety and Security section above.",

Medical facilities require prepayment for services and most do not accept credit cards.",
      "Effective emergency response to personal injury and illness is virtually non-existent in most of Pakistan. Ambulances are few, lack medical equipment, and are not necessarily staffed by medical personnel. Bring sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications. Many U.S. -brand medications are not available, there is a high incidence of fake pharmaceuticals, and the quality of locally-produced medications is uneven.",

Travelers are urged to use the same cautionary and protective health measures they would in their own country.",

      "Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Pakistan are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences in local prisons and heavy fines.",
      "Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate immediately to ensure we are aware of your circumstances and can provide assistance. See our webpage for further information. Pakistani law enforcement authorities will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate if a foreign citizen is arrested or detained, unless you request they do so. Pakistan’s regulations governing the travel of foreign diplomats and the procedures for gaining access to arrested individuals have delayed consular access in the past. In some cases, a Consular officer may not be able to visit due to security-related travel restrictions.",
      "Currency:",
      "Pakistan is largely a cash economy. Neither personal checks or travelers’ checks are commonly accepted in Pakistan. Outside major cities, credit cards are generally not accepted, and there have been numerous reports of credit card fraud. There are bank branches as well as registered currency exchangers and ATMs in all international airports.",
      "Forced Marriage : There are reports of U.S. citizen women of Pakistani heritage being tricked into traveling to Pakistan by their families and being forced into marriage. The U.S. government considers forced marriage to be a violation of basic human rights and in the case of minors, a form of child abuse. Forced marriage is defined as one in which one or both parties have not consented to the marriage (or are incapable of providing meaningful consent), and differs from arranged marriage. International laws and conventions support minimum ages for marriage and the individual’s right to choice in marriage. Pakistani civil law – as well as Sharia law - requires the consent of both parties for a legitimate marriage. Often, victims of forced marriage are subjected to non-consensual sex, physical and emotional abuse, isolation, and threats of violence. Persons who refuse a forced marriage are sometimes threatened with violence and being disowned from their families, who also often confiscate their belongings (including passports). In such situations, we may be able to replace stolen or wrongfully retained passports and identify resources for return travel to the United States. All U.S. citizens who fear for their safety or freedom to travel should ensure personal possession of important documents such as passports. Additionally, taking photos of items like Pakistani visas and entry stamps can often speed the process to replace such documents.",
      "Property Disputes: Some U.S. citizens have been kidnapped, assaulted, or threatened by family members in response to family disputes over property. Land disputes are common in Pakistan and are often difficult to resolve through legal channels. The U.S. Embassy cannot protect personal property and cannot take sides in a legal dispute. U.S. citizens wishing to purchase property should be aware of the risks, including not being physically present to oversee property. Those involved in a court dispute run the risk of having cases filed against them, and they may be arrested and jailed.",

      "The penalty for same-sex relations is a fine, imprisonment (sentences ranging from two years to life imprisonment), or both. No laws protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons rarely reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity.",

      "Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance . While in Pakistan, individuals with disabilities can find accessibility and accommodation difficult. The law provides for equality of the rights of persons with disabilities, but the legal provisions are not always implemented in practice.

In recent years, several U.S. citizens, including expert climbers, have lost their lives while climbing in the Karakoram mountain range, where rescue missions are often difficult or impossible to execute.

Terrorists also target Pakistani officials, government facilities, and religious minorities, and regularly resort to kidnapping for ransom. Attacks have included armed assaults on heavily guarded sites, including Pakistani military installations and airports. Other actions include, but are not limited to, suicide operations, bombings (including vehicle-borne explosives and improvised explosive devices), assassinations, carjackings, and assaults. The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in major cities, and these measures can vary from day to day.",
      "Demonstrations, political rallies or large religious gatherings intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We advise U.S. citizens to avoid areas where large crowds of any kind gather. During demonstrations or periods of civil unrest, the Pakistani government has in the past disabled cellular telephone and internet service, making it difficult for individuals to contact each other or the U.S. Embassy or Consulates.",
      "We recommend you limit the frequency of travel and minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, and other public locations. We advise against the use of public transportation in Pakistan. You are strongly urged to avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures. Official visitors are not authorized to stay overnight in local hotels anywhere in the country. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Mission sometimes places areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to official personnel.",
      "Threats to civil aviation in Pakistan are not limited to attacks where militants target airports. The U.S. government is aware of narcotics smuggled onto flights from Pakistan, which may indicate broader security vulnerabilities at Pakistani airports.",

Local police are not consistently responsive to reports of such cases.

      "Road Conditions and Safet y : While in Panama, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Travelers should carry identification with them at all times and be prepared to stop for unannounced checkpoints throughout the country, especially at night. Panama's roads, traffic and transportation systems are generally safe, but frequently traffic lights do not exist, even at busy intersections. Traffic in Panama moves on the right, as in the U.S., and Panamanian law requires that drivers and passengers wear seat belts.",
      "Driving in Panama is often hazardous and difficult due to heavy traffic, undisciplined driving habits, poorly maintained streets and a shortage of effective signs and traffic signals. Use caution when driving at night; night driving is particularly hazardous on the old Panama City – Colon highway. Riding your bicycle on the streets is not recommended.",
      "Road travel is more dangerous during the rainy season (April to December) due to flooding. Rainy season occasionally makes city streets impassible and washes out some roads in the interior of the country. In addition, roads in rural areas are often poorly maintained and lack illumination at night.",
      "There is often construction at night on Panama's portion of the Pan American highway. There are few signs alerting drivers to construction, and the highway is not well lit at night. When traveling on the highway, travelers should be aware of possible roadblocks. The Pan American Highway ends at Yaviza in the Darién Province of Panama and does not continue through to Colombia.",
      "Traffic Laws: Current Panamanian law allows foreigners to drive in Panama using their valid foreign driver’s license for a period of only 90 days. Driving without a valid driver’s license is illegal in all areas of Panama. Drivers stopped for driving while intoxicated may face the loss of their driver’s license, a monetary penalty, and vehicle impoundment. Talking on a cell phone or drinking an alcoholic beverage while driving also carries a fine.",
      "Third party liability auto insurance is mandatory, but many drivers are uninsured. If an accident occurs, a recent law requires that the vehicles be moved off the roadway; failure to do so could result in a fine. Individuals involved in non-injury accidents should take a photo of both cars, if safe to do so, and then pull their vehicle off the roadway. Exchange information with the other driver and wait for the police to arrive.",
      "Public Transportation : Public transportation should be used with caution. While we do still receive reports of thefts and pick-pocketing, new metro buses, with bigger windows and better lighting, have been introduced, and according to Panamanian National Police reports, seem to have reduced the instances of violent crime.",

These costs can be in excess of USD$10,000-$20,000, depending on the nature of the treatment. In Panama, most hospitals accept credit cards for hospital charges, but not for doctors' fees and do not accept international wire transfers or credit card payments over the phone.",

Violent crime in Serbia is most often associated with organized crime activities, but can also be the result of xenophobia. Tourists are not often the targets of violent crime, but killings associated with organized crime have occurred in places where tourists gather such as hotels, restaurants, shops, and busy streets. Tourists should pay attention to taxi meters and listed fares as taxi drivers may try to scam foreigners and charge higher rates.",

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Rwanda, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Traffic safety is hazardous due to excessive speeds, careless driving, poorly maintained vehicles, and lack of basic safety equipment on many vehicles. The main roads in Rwanda are in relatively good condition, but during the rainy season many side roads are passable only with four-wheel drive vehicles. Service stations are available along main roads. Due to possible language barriers and lack of roadside assistance, receiving help may be difficult.",
      "Use only official Kigali city buses, most of which are owned and operated by Kigali Bus Service, and established taxi or car services. Do not use motorcycle-taxis or mini-bus taxis as they are unsafe. Public transportation can be dangerous due to overloading, inadequate maintenance, and careless drivers. Regulated sedan auto taxis (which have a colored stripe along the doors) are safer, but fares should be negotiated before passengers embark. Car services tend to operate newer luxury vehicles.",
      "Nighttime driving, particularly outside major cities, is hazardous and is discouraged. Often, roadways are not marked and lack streetlights and shoulders. Many sections have deteriorated surfaces. Headlights are either extremely dim or not used. Police may stop travelers at roadblocks throughout the country and search the vehicle and luggage.",
      "Wear seat belts and drive with care and patience at all times. Exercise caution at traffic circles and traffic lights, as drivers do not always respect the right-of-way. Drivers tend to speed and pass other cars with little discretion. Some streets in Kigali have sidewalks or sufficient space for pedestrian traffic, while others do not, and pedestrians are forced to walk along the roadway. Street lighting is limited and drivers often have difficulty seeing pedestrians, cyclists, and livestock.",
      "Third-party insurance is required and will cover any damage from involvement in an accident resulting in injuries, if the driver is found not to have been at fault. The driver’s license of individuals determined to have caused an accident may be confiscated for three months.",
      "Causing a fatal accident could result in up to eight years imprisonment. Drunk drivers are jailed for 24 hours and fined up to $400.",
      "In the event of an emergency, U.S. citizens can contact the U.S. Embassy at 250-252-596400, then dial 1. Local police may be reached at 311 from any mobile phone.",
      "Rwandan traffic laws prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving and, if apprehended, the driver will be fined 10,000 RWF (about $15). Hands-free devices may be used. After-market tinted window treatments are prohibited on all vehicles; those ticketed for this offense will be required to remove them.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. For specific information concerning Rwandan driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, visit the website of the Rwanda Development Board , which is responsible for tourism, or the Rwanda National Police , which is responsible for road safety.\\",
      "AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Rwanda, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Rwanda’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page ."

There are some Western-trained physicians but many are locally trained, where the standard of medical education is not on par with the United States.",
      "There are very few emergency municipal response services. Ambulances are available in Kigali through the Service d'Aide médicale d'Urgence (Emergency Medical Service, SAMU) by calling 912 from any mobile phone, or through King Faisal Hospital at 078-830-9003. Ambulance service is basic and works solely as transportation, usually with no medical treatment involved. Ambulance companies expect payment either up front or upon delivery. They charge an initial 5,000 Rwandan Francs (RWF), and then an additional amount per kilometer traveled. Ambulances are extremely scarce outside of Kigali.",
      "In Kigali is King Faisal Hospital, a private hospital that offers 24-hour assistance with physicians and nurses on duty in the emergency room. Hospitals supported by U.S. organizations with some surgical facilities can be found in Kibagora, in southwestern Rwanda; in Ruhengeri, near the gorilla trekking area; and in Rwinkwavu, near the entrance to Akagera National Park. The National Teaching Hospital of the University of Rwanda is located in Huye (formerly Butare).",
      "Disease Outbreaks : Mosquito borne illnesses such as malaria and yellow fever are a major problem throughout the country. Prevention of bites and proper immunizations are important for all areas. Use mosquito repellents containing at least 20 percent DEET or picaridin and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets if possible. Malaria prophylactic medication should be initiated prior to entry. Many malaria prophylactic medicines are not available in Rwanda and, because of possible counterfeit of anti-malarial medications, should be obtained from a reliable pharmaceutical source before arrival.",
      "Be up-to-date on all childhood vaccinations . In addition, there are periodic outbreaks of meningitis in Rwanda, and the meningitis vaccine is recommended if travel will be taken during the dry season, May-October. Rabies is common in Rwanda; all animal bites, scratches, and licks should be immediately washed with soap and water and evaluated to determine if further rabies immunization is warranted. Pre-exposure rabies immunization is recommended for long-term travelers and adventure travelers who will be more than 24 hours away from reliable post-exposure treatment. Post-exposure treatment for rabies is not always available.",

Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different than our own and criminal penalties will vary from country to country. Persons violating Rwandan laws , even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned. Rwanda strictly enforces its laws about appropriate speech regarding the genocide. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Rwanda are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. In Rwanda, you may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport with you or if you take pictures of certain buildings.

      "Telecommunications: Telephone communication to and from Rwanda is generally reliable. Cellular telephones are available for purchase in many large towns and cellular service is reliable along most major routes in Rwanda. There are three main cellular providers: MTN, Tigo and Airtel. Internet service is increasingly available throughout Rwanda, but high-speed connections are often unavailable or unreliable and expensive.",
      "Currency: Travelers should expect to pay for most expenses, including airplane tickets, in cash. Most Rwandan banks and businesses do not accept traveler’s checks. The Rwandan franc is easily exchangeable for hard currencies in banks and cash exchange bureaus. Most banks and exchange bureaus will not accept U.S. currency printed before 2006 so travel with newer U.S. currency notes. Additionally, many exchange bureaus offer preferential rates for $100 bills and hotels or exchange bureaus may refuse to accept smaller bills.",
      "International ATMs are increasingly available in every major city in Rwanda. ATMs in Rwanda accept only Visa cards; MasterCard cards may be used for cash withdrawals for a fee at Access Bank locations co-located with Western Union offices. Beware of ATM skimmers at some ATMs which can steal card data for fraudulent use. Several banks in Kigali and Western Union branches can handle wire transfers from U.S. banks.",

Three attacks occurred in Kigali in 2013, killing five and injuring 42 persons. Two more attacks occurred in the city of Ruhengeri (also known as Musanze) in early 2014. Remain vigilant, exercise caution, and avoid crowds, demonstrations, or any other form of public gatherings.",
      "U.S. citizens should exercise extreme caution when traveling near the Rwanda-DRC border given the possibility of renewed fighting between the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) and the M23 armed group. While M23 was defeated militarily in November 2013, the FARDC and peacekeepers of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) continue to engage in combat operations against other armed groups in the DRC state of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda.",
      "In June 2014, cross-border fighting between the Rwandan Defence Forces and FARDC, north of the city of Gisenyi (also known as Rubavu), resulted in the deaths of several combatants. In late August 2013, cross-border fire landed within the borders of Rwanda, in Rubavu district, including within the city of Gisenyi. In early December 2012, a small element of armed individuals crossed the border from Eastern DRC and attacked a ranger camp northwest of Kinigi. The attack, which occurred just south of Volcanoes National Park, left one ranger dead. The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) claimed responsibility for this incursion. The FDLR is an armed group that includes former soldiers and supporters of the regime that orchestrated the 1994 genocide and that continues to operate in eastern DRC, near the border with Rwanda.",
      "An area of potential concern for a natural disaster is the Mount Nyiragongo volcano, just outside the eastern DRC town of Goma and near the Rwandan border. Mount Nyiragongo last erupted on January 17, 2002 killing 47 people, destroying 15 percent of Goma, and leaving 120,000 people homeless. Rwanda is also located in a seismically active region. In January 2008, an earthquake centered in eastern Congo killed 39 people and injured about 700, including residents of the Rwandan border town of Cyangugu. In November 2012, an earthquake centered in southern Uganda was felt as far south as Kigali.",

With a valid visitor visa and U.S. driver’s license, male visitors may drive a rental car. To drive vehicles other than rental cars, a Saudi driver’s license and appropriate car registration is required. Police may detain you if you cannot produce these documents. See the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Interior website for further information.",
      "Traffic Laws :",
      "Temporary male visitors may drive using their U.S. driver's license, though it may be advisable to also obtain an international driver’s license. Foreign men employed in Saudi Arabia must obtain a local driver's license from the Department of Traffic Police. Women are not allowed to drive or ride motorcycles, bicycles, or any other type of vehicle on public roads. A valid foreign or international driver’s license can be used for either a year or until the expiration date, whichever is closer. In the event of a traffic accident resulting in personal injury, everyone involved (if not seriously injured) may be taken to the local police station. All drivers, regardless of fault, are likely to be held for several days until responsibility is determined and any reparations paid. U.S. citizens involved in a serious accident resulting in injury or death should immediately contact their sponsors and the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate. Residents should update their personal details through one of the methods available here to receive SMS notifications once a traffic ticket is issued.

      "Women Residents and Travelers: Women must be met by their sponsor upon arrival according to Saudi Arabia’s regulations. Women who are traveling alone and are not met by sponsors have experienced delays before being allowed to enter the country or to continue on other flights. Married women, including non-Saudis, require their husband's permission to depart the country, while unmarried women and children require the permission of their father or male guardian. A mother’s consent will not suffice: minor children must have their father’s permission in order to leave the Kingdom. Children visiting their fathers in Saudi Arabia, even when there is a custody agreement, may be prevented from leaving unless the father consents. This is true even if the child is a U.S. citizen. The U.S. Embassy cannot obtain exit visas for the departure of minor children without their father's permission. A regulation enacted in 2008 requires Saudi men to sign a document giving irrevocable permission to their foreign wives and the children born of their union to travel in and out of the country without restrictions. In practice, authorities rarely require this document and it is not retroactive when signed. Even with such documentation, foreign spouses and their children may still have difficulty leaving Saudi Arabia freely. Foreign mothers of Saudi children, regardless of marital status, may apply for five-year permanent residency permits without the need for a sponsor. To do so, they must prove maternity and that they are (or were) legally married to Saudi citizens. If a foreigner and a Saudi living in Saudi Arabia divorce, the Saudi courts rarely grant permission for the foreign parent to leave the country with the children born during the marriage, even if he or she has been granted physical custody.

      "It is common practice for sponsors to demand that residents working in Saudi Arabia surrender their passports while in the Kingdom. Although this practice is technically illegal, sponsors are rarely, if ever, punished by the Saudi authorities for doing so. Sponsors have wide latitude and responsibilities for employees and family members under their sponsorship, including obtaining residence permits for the employee and for any family members. All residents should be issued a Saudi residence permit (Iqama) for identification and are recommended to carry it at all times. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in Saudi Arabia cannot sponsor private U.S. citizens for Saudi visas. Since the Saudi sponsor generally holds the employee's passport and controls the issuance of exit permits, U.S. citizens cannot leave Saudi Arabia in the event of a labor or business dispute, which could take months or years to resolve. To change employers within the Kingdom, Saudi Arabia requires the written permission of the original sponsoring employer. The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General cannot adjudicate labor or business disputes, nor can we provide translation or legal services. U.S. consular officers can provide lists of local attorneys to help U.S. citizens settle business disputes, but ultimate responsibility for the resolution of disputes through the Saudi legal system, and payment for those services, lies with the parties involved.

      "Teaching English in Saudi Arabia: English teachers comprise a large and growing segment of the U.S. expatriate population in Saudi Arabia. In the past few years, several teachers have complained about rapid dismissals and restrictions on their movement. Teachers should make sure they obtain the appropriate work visa prior to coming to Saudi Arabia. Business visas do not grant the applicant the right to work or to reside in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Employers of English teachers frequently issue short-term, single-entry work visas that coincide with a 90-day “probation” window, during which time the employee or employer can freely end the working relationship. Foreign employees must leave the country soon after dismissal or face deportation proceedings. Dismissed employees have little, if any, recourse or grounds for appeal. Further information can be found in our Guide to Teaching English in Saudi Arabia. Standards of Conduct and Religious Police: Norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are extremely conservative, and the religious police, referred to colloquially as the Mutawwa or Al-Hay’a , are charged with enforcing these standards.",
      "Mutawwa are required to carry special identification and usually are accompanied by uniformed police. If a police officer is present, Mutawwa have the power to take individuals to a police station or Mutawwa office. An individual must, if requested, hand over his or her residence permit (Iqama) or other identification to the police officer. U.S. citizens who are involved in an incident with the Mutawwa should report the incident to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh or the U.S. Consulates General in Jeddah or Dhahran.",
      "The Saudi government does not permit photography of governmental facilities such as military bases and government buildings. It is also sensitive to photography that may be perceived as portraying the country in an unfavorable light. This policy can include photos of mosques, impoverished areas, the local population, and traditional souks (markets). You should not take anyone’s picture without clear consent, and never take a picture of a woman or a place where women congregate. Be aware of local sensitivities whenever you are taking pictures in public.",
      "In most areas of Saudi Arabia, and particularly in Riyadh and the central part of the Kingdom, women wear a full-length black covering known as an abaya, and cover their heads. Women who choose not to conform to this dress code face a risk of confrontation by Mutawwa and possible detention/arrest. Men should also dress conservatively, and not wear shorts in public or go without a shirt.",
      "Many areas of life in Saudi Arabia are segregated by sex to ensure that unrelated men and women have no possibility of mingling (a punishable crime). Some Mutawwa try to enforce this by asking for proof that a couple is married or related. Women who are arrested for socializing with a man who is not a relative may be charged with prostitution. Some restaurants, particularly fast-food outlets, refuse to serve women who are not accompanied by a close male relative. In addition, some restaurants or cafes do not have a &quot;family section&quot; in which women are permitted to eat. Men not accompanied by a close female family member must stay out of family sections, and cannot use services (such as registers at supermarkets) designated as “family”. These restrictions are not always posted. This is more common in Riyadh and the more conservative central region known as the Nejd .",

There continue to be reports of threats against U.S. citizens and other Westerners, as well as locations frequented by them. ISIL and AQAP continue to encourage individual acts of terrorism in the Kingdom. Furthermore, continuing violence in neighboring countries such as Yemen has a potential to spill over into Saudi Arabia. U.S. government personnel are restricted from traveling within 50 miles of the border with Yemen, which includes the cities of Jizan and Najran, without permission from Embassy security officials. U.S. government personnel are similarly restricted from traveling to the city of Qatif in the Eastern Province and its surrounding suburbs, including Awamiyah, and to the town of Hofuf and its surrounding suburbs in the Al Hasa Governorate due to violent episodes that have occurred there in the past. Please take this into consideration when planning your travels within Saudi Arabia. You can find additional details relating to safety and security in our travel warning and the website of the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh . Crime: Crime in Saudi Arabia has increased over recent years, but remains at levels far below most major metropolitan areas in the United States.",

You should have at least two months’ validity left when you depart. You will not be allowed to leave the country without a visa, even if you are an American citizen.",
      "Further information can be found on the website of the U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia. Do not enter the country on a Saudi Laissez Passer (temporary travel document), or you may encounter difficulty leaving the Kingdom. We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens enter Saudi Arabia on a Saudi passport or a U.S. passport and Saudi visa, but not a Laissez Passer. To facilitate travel into the Kingdom, Saudi embassies sometimes issue a Laissez Passer for presumed Saudi citizens, such as children of a Saudi parent or parents who were married outside of Saudi Arabia; however, the traveler must then obtain a Saudi passport before leaving . Saudi nationality is not conferred quickly or easily, and the processing time for a Saudi passport in these cases has often been six months or more. Obtaining a U.S. passport at the Embassy will not help, as you will not be able to leave Saudi Arabia without a visa. Saudi Arabia does not recognize dual nationality. At times, Saudi authorities have confiscated the U.S. passports of U.S-Saudi dual nationals applying for Saudi citizenship. If this happens to you or someone you know, report the incident to the U.S. Embassy. This does not constitute loss of U.S. citizenship. Length of Stay: If you overstay your visa, you face fines, detention, and/or deportation. Upon arrival, confirm your permitted length of stay with Saudi immigration authorities. Dates are calculated in accordance with the Hijri calendar, which is significantly different from the Gregorian calendar. Resolving such errors can take several weeks. The U.S. Embassy is unable to intercede, reduce fines, or prevent incarceration if you violate Saudi law. Travel Bans: When placed under a travel ban, you cannot exit the country, even if you are a U.S. citizen. Travel bans are rigidly enforced and can take months or even years to resolve. Only Saudi Arabian authorities and sponsors can remove travel bans. The government may issue travel bans on people who are:",
      "charged with criminal offenses under investigation involved in financial or labor disputes/have unpaid debts",
      "Private citizens may also initiate travel bans against other private citizens for various reasons. Yemen Travel: We strongly advise U.S. citizens against travel to Yemen. For U.S. citizens departing Yemen we strongly discourage departing via the Yemen-Saudi Arabia border because it can be dangerous and U.S. citizens who attempt to do so are routinely detained or turned away by Saudi authorities. See our Yemen Crisis webpage for further information. Residency Permits: If you are seeking residency in Saudi Arabia, make sure you have all required legal documents authenticated before arriving. The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh cannot provide this service. You should have all U.S. issued documents authenticated by the Department of State Office of Authentications (202-485-8000), and attested by the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington D.C. Work Visas: If you plan on working in Saudi Arabia, you must obtain a work visa before you arrive. If you work on another visa type, you risk financial penalties and deportation. HIV/AIDS: To obtain work and residence permits, you are required to obtain a medical report or physical examination confirming that you are free from contagious diseases, including HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis. If you test positive for HIV/AIDS, you will not be allowed to work in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia has not imposed HIV/AIDS travel restrictions on other categories of travelers.

Road signs and traffic rules are consistent with those used throughout Europe. Parts of the Center are closed to vechicular traffic. Be alert to aggressive drivers both in cities and on highways. Many of the serious accidents in Slovenia occur as a result of high-speed driving. Emergency roadside assistance and towing services are available by dialing 1987. Dial 112 for an ambulance or fire brigade, and 113 for police. Current information about traffic and road conditions is available in English from the Automobile Association of Slovenia by calling (01) 530-5300 and from the Traffic Information Center for Public Roads .",
      "Traffic Laws:",
      "Third-party liability insurance is required for all vehicles. You can purchase coverage locally. Travelers driving rented automobiles from Croatia into Slovenia are generally able to purchase Slovenian insurance at the border, though the process may take a few hours. Don’t drink and drive. The maximum legal blood-alcohol limit for drivers is 0.05 (0.00 percent for novice drivers with less than two years of experience, any driver under 21 years of age, and drivers of trucks and buses). You must keep headlights on during both at night and during the day. Wear a seat belt in a car and a helmet on a motorcycle. It’s the law! It’s illegal to use hand-held cellular phones while driving in Slovenia and turning right on red is not allowed. Between November 15 and March 15, all cars must have winter tires or appropriate all-season tires. In addition, local police may require chains in heavy snow. If you get a ticket, you may be offered the opportunity to pay a reduced fine on the spot. If you choose not to pay the fine on the spot, the police may confiscate your passport or other document until you pay the fine. Vignettes : Highway vignettes (in the form of properly-affixed windshield stickers) are required for all passenger vehicles and motorcycles using highways. One of the most common problems faced by U.S. citizens visiting Slovenia is being pulled over on a highway for driving without a vignette. You can purchase a vignette at gas stations, newsstands, automobile clubs, post offices (Posta Slovenije), and some toll stations, as well as at some gas stations in neighboring countries. If you are driving into Slovenia from a neighboring country and will be using the Slovenia highway system, we recommend that you buy your vignette at a gas station before you reach the Slovenian border. If you don’t have a vignette, you could face steep penalties.",
      "Driver’s licenses: You must have both a valid U.S. driver’s license and an International Driving Permit to drive legally in Slovenia. After one year in Slovenia, you are required to obtain a Slovenian driver’s license. Two automobile associations are authorized by the U.S. Department of State to issue International Driving Permits: the American Automobile Association and the American Automobile Touring Alliance (through the National Auto Club ).",
      "Public Transportation : While taxis are generally safe and reliable, taxi drivers have been known to overcharge tourists by shutting off their meters. When using a taxi, you should first ask for an estimated fare and check to see that the meter is running during the journey. Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the website of Slovenia's national tourist office and the Slovenian Roads Agency .",
      "Bicycling: Bicycling is popular in Slovenia, and cities have well-developed bicycling networks with marked bicycle lanes along most roads. Slovenia has more rules governing cyclists than the United States. You could get a ticket if you break those rules. There are also special rules regarding children and bicycles. Please visit Slovenia’s Bicycle Safety page for a list of rules and advice for cyclists.",

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Italy, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Italy has one of the highest rates of car accident deaths in the European Union. Streets in historic city centers are often narrow, winding, and congested. Motor scooters are very popular, and scooter drivers often see themselves as exempt from conventions that apply to automobiles. Pedestrians and drivers should be constantly alert to the possibility of a scooter’s sudden presence. Most vehicle-related deaths and injuries involve pedestrians or cyclists who are involved in collisions with scooters or other vehicles. Be particularly cautious if you rent a scooter. You should remain vigilant and alert when walking or cycling near traffic. Pedestrians should be careful, as sidewalks can be extremely congested and uneven. Riders of bicycles, motorcycles, and other vehicles routinely ignore traffic signals and traffic flows, and park and drive on sidewalks. For safety, pedestrians should look carefully in both directions before crossing streets, even when using a marked crosswalk with a green avanti (&quot;walk&quot;) light illuminated.",
      "Traffic lights are limited and often disobeyed and a different convention of right-of-way is observed. Italy has over 5,600 kilometers (3,480 mi.) of Autostrada, or superhighways. Commercial and individual vehicles travel and pass on these well-maintained roads at very high speeds. In rural areas, a wide range of speed on highways makes for hazardous driving. Roads are generally narrow and often have no guardrails. Travelers in northern Italy, especially in winter, should be aware of fog and poor visibility responsible for multiple-car accidents each year. Most Italian automobiles are equipped with special fog lights. Roadside assistance in Italy is excellent on the well-maintained toll roads, but limited on secondary roads. Use of safety belts and child restraining devices is mandatory and headlights should be on at all times outside of urban areas.",
      "U.S. citizens driving in Italy should also note that, according to Italian regulation, if a resident of a non-European Union country (e.g., the United States) violates a traffic law, the violator must pay the fine at the time the violation occurs to the police officer issuing the ticket. If the citizen does not or cannot pay the fine at the time, Italian regulation allows the police officer to confiscate the offender’s vehicle (even if the vehicle is a rental vehicle).",
      "For specific information concerning Italian driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, contact the Italian Government Tourist Board (ENIT), tel: 212-245-5618; or the A.C.I. (Automobile Club d’Italia) at Via Marsala 14A, 00185 Rome, tel: 39-06-4998-2496. For information on obtaining international drivers licenses, contact AAA or the American Automobile Touring Alliance.

Public hospitals, though generally free of charge for emergency services, sometimes do not maintain the same standards as hospitals in the United States, so you are encouraged to obtain insurance that would cover a stay in a private Italian hospital or clinic. It is almost impossible to obtain an itemized hospital bill from public hospitals, as required by many U.S. insurance companies, because the Italian National Health Service charges one inclusive rate for care services and room and board.",

      "You must obey local transportation laws and regulations. You must purchase train tickets and validate them by inserting them into validating machines, which are usually located near the entrance of train tracks, prior to boarding. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an on-the-spot fine by an inspector on the train. You must purchase bus tickets prior to boarding and validate them immediately after boarding. Tickets may be purchased at tobacco stores or kiosks. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an immediate fine imposed by an inspector on the bus. If the violator does not pay the fine on the spot, it will automatically double and will be forwarded to the violator’s home address.",
      "You must obey local driving laws and regulations. Vehicle traffic in some historic downtown areas of cities and towns throughout Italy is limited by a system of permits (called “ZTL,” functioning the same way as an electronic toll system in the United States might on the freeway). Cameras record the license plates of cars driving in parts of the city that require a permit. Although most of the automated verification stations are clearly marked, if a driver passes one, it is impossible to know at the time that a violation occurred or has been recorded. Violators are not pulled over or stopped, and there is no personal contact with a police officer. Whenever possible, the fines imposed for these violations are forwarded to the driver’s home in the United States to request payment. Notice from Italian authorities of a violation may take a year or longer to arrive. The fines are cumulative for each time a driver passes a control point. A similar system of automated traffic control cameras is in place in many parts of the highway system and is used to ticket speeding violations.",
      "Accessibility: While in Italy, travelers with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what is found in the United States. Many find Italy’s narrow cobbled streets and storied monuments charming; they can, however, be a challenge for physically impaired travelers. Many Italian sidewalks lack ramps, some Italian streets lack sidewalks altogether, or for instance in the case of Venice, may feature staircases and narrow pedestrian bridges. While some major sights and hotels have put time and planning into ensuring accessibility, there are others that lack ramps, elevators, or handicap-accessible bathrooms. Advance planning can go a long way in making a difference in accommodation for disabled travelers. Inform airlines and hotels of your disabilities when making reservations as some time may be needed to prepare accommodation. Call ahead to restaurants, museums, and other facilities to find out if they are wheelchair-accessible. Most, but not all, train stations in Italy have accommodations for those traveling in wheelchairs. With advance notice, personal assistance can be provided to a disabled person traveling through a particular station. More information is available at Trenitalia's website addressing disabled travelers . For those who wish to rent cars, hand-controlled vehicles are available in Italy from major car-rental companies. You should contact the car rental company well in advance of your trip in order to reserve the vehicle. Remember that Italy functions on 220 volt current. To recharge an electric wheelchair motor, you may require a transformer to change the 220 current to 110 volts, as well as an adapter to adjust the plug to fit Italian electrical sockets.",

If you are drinking heavily, your ability to judge situations and make decisions may be impaired, making you a target for crime. Young drinkers are particularly vulnerable to robbery and physical and sexual assault.",
      "Petty crimes such as pick-pocketing, theft from parked cars, and purse snatching are serious problems, especially in large cities. Pick-pockets sometimes dress like businessmen. You should not be lulled into a false sense of security by believing that well-dressed individuals are not potential pick-pockets or thieves. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, on public buses and trains, and at the major railway stations: Rome's Termini; Milan's Centrale; Florence's Santa Maria Novella; and Naples's Centrale at Piazza Garibaldi. For more information on trains and security, please see the Italian railway police’s advice for travelers . You should also be alert to theft in Milan’s Malpensa Airport, particularly at car rental agencies. Clients of Internet cafes in major cities are also targeted. Be careful with your bag or purse, as thieves on motor scooters are very quick and can snatch a purse off of your arm from a moving scooter. Resisting these thieves can be hazardous, as some tourists have suffered broken arms and collarbones.",
      "Thieves in Italy often work in groups or pairs. Pairs of accomplices or groups of children are known to divert tourists' attention so that another can pick-pocket them. In one particular routine, one thief drops or spills something on the victim; a second thief assists the victim in cleaning up the mess; and the third discreetly takes the victim's belongings. Criminals on crowded public transportation slit the bottoms of purses or bags with a razor blade or sharp knife removing the contents.",
      "Some travelers in Rome, Florence, and Naples have reported incidents where criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. These incidents have been reported near Rome’s Termini train station; at bars and cafes near Rome’s Colosseum, Colle Oppio, Campo de Fiori, and Piazza Navona; and at bars and cafes in the center of Florence and Naples. Criminals using this tactic “befriend” you at a train station, restaurant, café, or bar, and then offer you a drink laced with a sleeping drug. When you fall asleep, criminals steal your valuables and may sexually assault you. Some victims of these assaults in Rome have required hospitalization and two cases resulted in death.",
      "Thieves are also known to have impersonated police officers in order to steal. The thief shows you a circular plastic sign with the words &quot;police&quot; or “international police&quot; and then in perfect English asks to see your identification and your money. U.S. citizens should be aware that local police will generally exit their own vehicle when speaking with members of the public. Also, plainclothes undercover units rarely attempt to pull over vehicles without a marked car accompanying them. If this happens to you, you should insist on seeing the officer's identification card (documento) before handing over your wallet as impersonators tend not to carry forged documents. You should immediately report thefts or other crimes to the actual police.",

Use particular caution driving at night on highways, when thieves are more likely to strike. U.S. citizens have reported break-ins of their rental cars during stops at highway service areas; thieves smash car windows and steal everything inside. Theft of small items such as radios, luggage, cameras, briefcases, and even cigarettes from parked cars is prevalent. Vehicles parked near beaches during the summer can be broken into and robbed of valuables. Lock car doors whenever you park, and do not leave packages in your car in plain view.",
      "The U.S. Secret Service in Rome is assisting Italian law enforcement authorities in investigating an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. These devices are attached to legitimate bank ATMs, usually located in tourist areas, and capture the account information stored electronically on the card’s magnetic strip. The devices consist of a card reader installed over the legitimate reader and a pin-hole video camera mounted above the keypad that records the customer’s PIN. ATMs with skimming devices installed may also allow normal transactions to occur. The victim’s information is sold, traded on-line, or encoded on another card, such as a hotel key card, to access the compromised account. Here are some helpful hints to protect against and identify skimming devices:",

Another government official was gunned down in Bakara Market, Hawlwadaag district. On May 24, 2014, an al-Shabaab suicide assault team attacked the Somalia's parliament building in Mogadishu. On March 15, a car bomb detonated near a hotel in central Mogadishu, popular with local government officials and businessmen, killing two. On February 27, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant popular with Somali security services, killing twelve. On February 21, al-Shabaab militants attacked Villa Somalia, the official residential palace and principal workplace of the President of Somalia, and killed two government officials. On February 13, militants detonated a VBIED targeting a convoy carrying high-level UN officials as they waited to enter the main gate of Mogadishu airport. On January 1, unknown attackers launched an indirect fire attack on the airport.",
      "Al-Shabaab has lost control of large portions of southern and central Somalia due to the success of the Africa Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)-led Operation Indian Ocean offensive; however, armed banditry, road assaults, kidnappings for ransom, shootings and grenade attacks on public markets, and detonations of anti-personnel and-vehicle land mines still occur in most parts of the country. Al-Shabaab remains engaged in active warfare against the central government and regional administrations, including Puntland and Galmuduug. Illegal roadblocks by armed men, sometimes in government uniforms, are common throughout Somalia and have resulted in serious injury or death.",
      "Cross-border violence occurs periodically. The area near Somalia’s border with Kenya has been the site of numerous violent incidents, ranging from large-scale clashes between al-Shabaab and the central government to kidnappings, and grenade attacks on hostels used by international aid workers. U.S. citizens who decide to visit the area should be aware that they could encounter such incidents.",

Marine channels 12, 13 and 16 VHF-FM are international call-up and emergency channels and are commonly monitored by ships at sea. 2182 MHz is the HF international call-up and emergency channel. In the Gulf of Aden, use of transit routes farther offshore appears to reduce, but does not eliminate, the risk of contact with assailants. Wherever possible, travel in trafficked sea-lanes. Avoid loitering in or transiting isolated or remote areas. In the event of an attack, activate the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon. Due to distances involved, there may be a considerable delay before assistance arrives. Vessels may also contact the Yemeni Coast Guard 24-hour Operations Center at 967-1-562-402. Operations Center staff members speak English.",

      "The U.S. Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to Somalia. Since the collapse of the central government in 1991, Somalia has been subject to widespread violence and instability. In 2012 the Transitional Federal Government was succeeded by a new federal government. In January 2013, the United States officially recognized the Somali government for the first time since 1991. However, the U.S. government does not maintain a diplomatic presence in Somalia at this time. Regional administrations, like the semi-autonomous state of Puntland and the self-declared “independent” region of Somaliland, have evolved in parts of the country. In August 2013, the federal government and Juba administration reached an agreement, which established the Interim Juba Administration in southern Somalia. Somalia's infrastructure and economy were seriously damaged by the civil war and its aftermath, but the private sector is trying to reemerge and has been boosted by an influx of diaspora returning to Somalia since the end of the transitional period of governance.",
      "The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), with the assistance of Somali security forces, have liberated the capital city of Mogadishu and other key cities in southern and central Somalia from the control of al-Shabaab, a radical Islamist movement and designated foreign terrorist organization affiliated with al-Qa’ida, but the central government’s reach and ability to provide services remains limited. Al-Shabaab still maintains control of towns and villages in Somalia’s countryside and retains the capability to conduct terrorist attacks throughout Somalia and in neighboring countries. While al-Shabaab has lost ground in southern and central Somalia, it remains capable of waging terrorist acts and asymmetric warfare. Criminal groups conduct kidnapping for ransom and piracy, particularly in the regions of Galmuduug and Puntland, although the number of incidents have decreased with the introduction of land and sea-based initiatives to counter piracy. Inter- and intra-clan violence also frequently occurs throughout the country.",

      "Obey the traffic light located at your stop line, as there are separate traffic lights for each side of the intersection. Be alert when driving at night in urban areas because of the possibility of encountering drivers or pedestrians under the influence of alcohol. Night driving in isolated rural areas can be dangerous because of farm animals and poorly marked roads. Rural traffic is generally heavier in July and August as well as during the Christmas and Easter seasons.

It is illegal to rent a vehicle if you don’t have an International Driving Permit. Your rental car may be impounded and you will be required to pay a fine if stopped. It is against the law to use a mobile phone without a hands-free device while driving. There is a 300 Euros fine for violating this regulation, which may also cause you to lose your license. All drivers and passengers are required to wear a reflective vest if they need to stop on the roadside. A reflective triangle warning sign is also mandatory if you stop on the roadside. You must have liability insurance to operate any car or motorcycle. If you are stopped by the Spanish National Police or the Guardia Civil, they may levy fines on the spot and issue a receipt for payment. This ensures that the fine is paid by a foreigner who may not return to Spain to pay the fine.",

      "Passports and visa : U.S. citizens must have a U.S. passport that is valid for 6 months following your departure date. No visa is required if you have an onward or return ticket, confirmation of accommodation, and can produce evidence of your ability to maintain yourself. NOTE : Be aware that Caribbean cruises that begin and end in the United States (closed loop cruises) do not require that you travel with a valid passport. However, should you need to disembark due to an emergency and you do not have a valid passport, you may encounter difficulties entering or remaining in a foreign country. You may also have difficulty attempting to re-enter the United States by air because many airlines will require a valid passport before allowing you to board the aircraft. As such, we strongly recommend that you always travel abroad with your valid passport. HIV/AIDS: Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions may exist.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Sudan, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States.",
      "Road conditions throughout Sudan are hazardous due to erratic driver behavior, pedestrians, and animals in the roadways, and vehicles that are overloaded or lack basic safety equipment. Only major highways and some streets in the cities are paved; many roads are narrow, rutted, and poorly maintained. While there are functioning traffic signals on major streets in Khartoum, there are virtually none in other parts of the country. Local drivers often do not observe conventions for the right-of-way, stop on the road without warning, and frequently exceed safe speeds for road, traffic, and weather conditions. Driving at night is dangerous and should be avoided if possible; many vehicles operate without lights.",
      "In northern and western Sudan, dust and sand storms, known as “haboobs,” greatly reduce visibility when they occur. Roads in these areas can be quickly covered with shifting sand at any season of the year. Roads in southern Sudan are often impassable during the rainy season which usually lasts from March to October. Spare tires, parts, and fuel should be taken when traveling in remote areas, as service stations are separated by long distances. U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the country in which they are traveling, including traffic laws. In Sudan, vehicles have the steering wheel on the left side and drivers use the right side of the road.",
      "Traffic from side streets on the right has the right-of-way when entering a cross street, including fast-moving main streets. Traffic on the right has the right-of-way at stops. Right turns on a red light are prohibited. Speed limits are not posted, but the legal speed limit for passenger cars on inter-city highways is 120 kph (about 75 mph), while in most urban areas, the limit is 60 kph (about 35 mph). The speed limit in congested areas and school zones is 40 kph (about 25 mph).",
      "Many local drivers carry no insurance despite the legal requirement that all motor vehicle operators purchase third-party liability insurance from the government. Persons involved in an accident resulting in death or injury must report the incident to the nearest police station or police officer as soon as possible. Persons found at fault can expect fines, revocation of driving privileges, and jail sentences, depending on the nature and extent of the accident. Persons convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol face fines, jail sentences, and flogging.",
      "U.S. citizens may use their U.S. driver's license for up to 90 days after arrival in Sudan, and then must carry either an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a Sudanese driver's license. There are no restrictions on vehicle types, including motorcycles and motorized tricycles.",
      "Public transportation exists in cities and between major urban areas. Passenger facilities are basic and crowded, especially during rush hours and periods of seasonal travel. Schedules are unpublished and subject to change without notice. There is routine passenger train service on the route from Khartoum to Wadi Halfa (on the border with Egypt) and to Port Sudan (on the Red Sea). Bus service between major cities is regular and inexpensive. Intra-city bus service in the major urban areas is by small and large buses, and vans. Many drivers of these vehicles have little training and are reckless, and the vehicles are often poorly maintained. Most buses and bus stops are privately operated and unmarked. Taxis are available in the major cities at hotels, tourist sites, and government offices. Motorized rickshaws, in common use in Khartoum, are unsafe. Travelers are encouraged to hire cars and drivers from reputable sources with qualified drivers and safe vehicles. While there is some public transit to rural communities by irregularly scheduled mini-buses, many areas lack any public transportation.",
      "You should be extremely careful in crossing roads in Sudan. Crosswalks do not exist, and incidents of cars striking pedestrians do occur.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information",
      "AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Sudan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page ."

      "Persons with conditions which may require medical treatment are strongly discouraged from traveling to Sudan. Medical facilities in Khartoum fall short of U.S. standards; outside the capital, few facilities exist and hospitals and clinics are poorly equipped. Emergency medical treatment is provided without cost for the first 24 hours, but after that, payment will be required. For all other non-emergent medical treatment, payment in cash must be made in advance. Ambulance services are not available outside Khartoum. Medicines are available only intermittently; you should bring sufficient supplies of needed medicines in clearly marked containers.",
      "Malaria is a mosquito-borne infection that is highly prevalent in all areas of Sudan. Chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria causes 90 percent of cases and travelers are advised to arrive with an adequate supply of mefloquine, doxycycline, or atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone), as locally-acquired antimalarials are frequently counterfeit. In addition to malaria, yellow fever and dengue are other mosquito-borne illnesses that are present. The vaccine for yellow fever is required for those arriving from other countries with yellow fever transmission and is recommended for all those visiting areas south of the Sahara.",
      "Meningococcal meningitis is common during the dry season of December through June and travelers, especially children and health care workers, should consider quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine before traveling. Rabies exists in most of the country and travelers should avoid contact with animals, especially dogs and bats. Those traveling in remote areas or for longer than four weeks should consider rabies immunization before traveling; all bites and scratches from animals should be thoroughly washed and evaluated.",
      "Schistosomiasis is a worm whose larval stage penetrates intact skin when swimming in fresh water. This parasite is especially common in the Nile River and its tributaries. Fresh water swimming or wading should be avoided.",
      "Travelers are advised to consult a health provider before traveling, obtain suitable anti-malarial drugs, ensure that all your vaccines are up to date, and use protective measures, such as insect repellent, protective clothing, and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. If you become ill with a fever or a flu-like illness while in Sudan, or within a year after departure, you should promptly seek medical care and inform your physician of your travel history and the kind of anti-malarial drugs used. For additional information about malaria and anti-malarial drugs, please see the Center for Disease Control information on malaria (CDC).",
      "You can find detailed information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the CDC website .

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Sudan, you are subject to its laws. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own. Persons violating Sudanese laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Sudan are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. In Sudan, you may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport with you or if you take pictures of certain buildings. In Sudan, driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. If you break local laws in Sudan, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution.",
      "There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",
      "Arrest notifications in Sudan: While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested in that country, others may not. Sudanese authorities often fail to notify the U.S. Embassy of the arrest of a U.S. citizen. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas. Even if notified, the U.S. Embassy is often not allowed access to arrested/detained U.S. citizens in Sudan.",
      "Dual-nationals must be aware that the Sudanese government may not recognize your U.S. citizenship, and if detained/arrested, you may be prosecuted as a Sudanese national.",
      "SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: In November 1997, the United States imposed comprehensive financial and commercial sanctions on Sudan. Travelers intending to visit Sudan should contact the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) , Office of Compliance, telephone 1-800-540-6322 or 202-622-2490, regarding the effect of these sanctions.",
      "You must be prepared to pay cash for all purchases, including hotel bills, airfares purchased locally, and all other travel expenses. Major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, cannot be used in Sudan due to U.S. sanctions. Sudan has no international ATMs. Local ATMs draw on local banks only.",
      "Exchanging money on the black market is illegal. U.S. currency issued prior to 1996 is generally not accepted anywhere in Sudan, and $100 bills must be issued after 2006. Travelers often experience difficulty transferring cash into the country, and travelers carrying large amounts of U.S. currency have been detained. Western Union operates in Khartoum.",
      "Sudan is a conservative society, particularly in the capital and other areas where the Muslim population is the majority. Modest dress and behavior is expected for both men and women. Loose, long-sleeved shirts and full-length skirts or slacks are recommended attire for female visitors. Women who are not Muslim are not expected or required to cover their heads. Men may wear short-sleeved shirts, but short pants are not acceptable in public.",
      "If you are a woman traveling abroad, please review our travel tips for women travelers .",
      "LGBT RIGTHS: Sudanese law prohibits consensual same-sex sexual relations. Penalties include death; however, there are no recent reports of this law being enforced. A few LGBT organizations operate in Khartoum but cannot openly identify as LGBT entities, and the LGBT community is subject to harassment and is unable to seek legal protection. Anti-discrimination laws do not apply to LGBT persons. Official discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity occurs. Societal discrimination against LGBT persons is widespread. Vigilantes target suspected gay men and lesbians for violent abuse, and there are public demonstrations against homosexuality. There are no reports of official action to investigate or punish those complicit in LGBT-related abuses. For more detailed information about LGBT rights in Sudan you may review the State Department’s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices . For further information on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) travel, please read our LGBT travel information page .",

      "On January 1, 2008, a group of assailants shot and killed two U.S. Embassy employees – a USAID officer and a Sudanese national driver. The attack was found to be ideologically motivated, and the assailants were convicted and sentenced under Sudanese law in 2009. Only one of the four convicted assailants is in custody; one is believed to have been killed in Somalia, and two remain at large.",
      "Aid workers and government employees from Western countries have been the targets of kidnappings in the Darfur region. In May 2010, a U.S. citizen employed by a humanitarian relief organization was kidnapped in Darfur, and was held for several months before being released. In July 2014, two American citizens traveling on a bus in Darfur were attacked by anti-government forces and seriously wounded.",
      "Since June 2012, there have been increased incidents of anti-government protests, resulting in the arrest of at least one U.S. citizen. U.S. citizens should avoid crowds and demonstrations as they can become confrontational and quickly escalate into violence. Demonstrations may also occur in other areas of the country, and we recommend U.S. citizens throughout Sudan exercise caution.",
      "",
      "",
      "Terrorist-affiliated individuals are known to operate in Sudan, some of whom may seek opportunities to carry out attacks against U.S. or western interests. Terrorist actions may include suicide operations, bombings, or kidnappings. You should be aware of the risk of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in public places, including tourist sites and locations where westerners are known to congregate, and commercial operations associated with U.S. or Western interests. You should exercise utmost caution at all times.",
      "The Embassy’s ability to provide consular services outside of the Khartoum area, including emergency assistance, is severely limited. Many areas of Sudan are extremely difficult to access, and travel in these areas is hazardous. Outside the major cities infrastructure is extremely poor, medical care is limited, and there are few facilities for tourists.",
      "Conflict among various armed groups and government forces continues throughout the entire Darfur region. Banditry and lawlessness are prevalent in all of Darfur. Over one and a half million Darfuris live in camps for internally displaced persons, and receive humanitarian assistance for basic needs such as food, water, and shelter. Expatriate humanitarian workers have been the targets of kidnapping, car-jacking, and burglary.",
      "Occasional clashes between armed groups representing communal interests continue to occur in areas of central and eastern Sudan. Banditry also occurs. Sudan is Africa’s third-largest country in physical area, and shares porous land borders with Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Conflict in these countries occasionally spills over into Sudan. Violence in the nation of South Sudan inhibits land travel across Sudan’s southern border.",
      "The secession of South Sudan in July 2011 has been accompanied by an increase in armed violence in the states and territories on the northern South Sudan border, particularly in Abyei, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In ongoing disputes in these regions, the Sudanese Armed Forces have conducted airstrikes throughout the region, and have engaged in ground clashes with the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army/ North(SPLM/N). Non-governmental organizations have been expelled from the areas, and the United Nations operates with minimal staffing in government-controlled areas only.",
      "U.S. citizens considering sea travel in Sudan's coastal waters should exercise caution as there have been incidents of armed attacks and robberies by unknown groups in recent years, including one involving U.S. vessels. Exercise extreme caution, as these groups are considered armed and dangerous. When transiting in and around the Horn of Africa and/or in the Red Sea near Yemen, vessels should convoy in groups and maintain good communications contact at all times. Marine channels 13 and 16 VHF-FM are international call-up and emergency channels, and are commonly monitored by ships at sea. 2182 MHz is the HF international call-up and emergency channel. Wherever possible, travel in trafficked sea-lanes, and avoid loitering in or transiting isolated or remote areas. In case of emergency, contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. In the event of an attack, consider activating Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons.",
      "The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) has advised that elevated regional tensions have increased the risk of maritime attacks being conducted by extremists on vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Bab el Mandeb regions.",
      "MARAD recommends vessels at anchor, operating in restricted maneuvering environments, or at slow speeds should be especially vigilant, and report suspicious activity. U.S. flag vessels that observe suspicious activity in the area are advised to report such suspicious activity or any hostile or potentially hostile action to COMUSNAVCENT battlewatch captain at phone number 011-973-1785-3879.

U.S. citizen travelers must obtain an entry visa from a Sudanese embassy before arriving in Sudan. There are two exceptions to this requirement: U.S. citizens possessing a Sudanese national identification document (such as a Sudanese passport or national identification card), and travelers with a sponsor (a business or organization) that has obtained an entry permit for them in advance from the Sudanese Ministry of Interior may apply for an entry visa at Khartoum International Airport. The Government of Sudan routinely denies entry visas to travelers whose passports contain visas issued by the Government of Israel or other evidence of travel to Israel, such as exit or entry stamps.",
      "You must obtain an exit visa before departing from Sudan and pay any airport departure tax not included in your airline ticket. Travelers with expired entry visas or residence permits are regularly refused exit visas, except for those with a written request from the Sudanese sponsor of the visa. Spouses and children of Sudanese citizens (including Sudanese-U.S. dual-national citizens and U.S. citizens of Sudanese origin) are generally required by authorities to provide evidence that the Sudanese spouse/parent has consented to their departure when applying for an exit visa. Sudanese (and Sudanese/U.S. dual national) children under 18 years of age cannot leave Sudan without written approval from their father, even when the child is traveling with his/her mother.

You should exercise caution if driving in Syria because conditions are hazardous, in addition to the threat posed by the active conflict.",
      "Although drivers generally follow traffic signs and signals in urban centers, they maneuver aggressively and show little regard for vehicles traveling near them. Lane markings are usually ignored. Different from the United States, vehicles within Syrian traffic circles must give way to entering traffic. At night, it is very difficult to see pedestrians, who often walk into traffic with little warning. Outside major cities, it is common to find pedestrians, animals and vehicles on unlighted roads at night.",
      "Pedestrians should also exercise caution. Parked cars, deteriorating pavement, and guard posts obstruct sidewalks, often forcing pedestrians to walk in the street. Vehicles often do not stop for pedestrians, and regularly run red lights or “jump” the green light well before it changes. Drivers and passengers are subject to demands for money, harassment and abduction throughout the country.

Women who are arrested under suspicion of immoral behavior (e.g. being alone in a room with a man who is not the woman’s husband, or being in a residence where drugs or alcohol are being consumed) may be subjected to a virginity test. In addition, the Syrian government monitors the activities of all groups, including religious groups, and discourages proselytizing, which it deems a threat to relations among religious groups. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.",

The Department of State strongly recommends that U.S. citizens remaining in Syria despite the U.S. Department of State’s Syria Travel Warning depart immediately.

Four and five star hotels and high-end stores in Syria generally accept credit cards, although most restaurants, stores and shops operate exclusively in cash. Foreigners visiting Syria are required to pay hotel bills in U.S. dollars, Euros or other non-Syrian hard currency. Traveler’s checks are not accepted in Syria and banks will not cash them unless the traveler has an account at the bank in question. There are no U.S.-based banks operating in Syria. There are fourteen private banks operating in Syria, with branches and ATMs in most major cities. These ATMs usually honor major debit/credit systems. U.S. banks are restricted by law from transacting business with the largest public bank in Syria, the CBS, therefore U.S. banks will not process ATM transactions from CBS branches. Funds may be transferred into Syria through Western Union. Wiring of funds through private banks is possible only if the traveler already holds an account with the bank in Syria; transferring funds through the Commercial Bank of Syria is not possible because of U.S. sanctions. Restrictions on wire transfers from Syria to locations abroad and restrictions on withdrawing U.S. dollars have changed several times in 2011 because of the fluctuating political situation; private citizens seeking to transfer funds outside of Syria or to withdraw U.S. dollars from a bank in Syria should check with the relevant financial institution for the most up-to-date regulations.",

      "For Syrians (including U.S. citizens of either Syrian or Palestinian origin) born outside of Syria and residing abroad until the age of 18, the fee for exemption from military service is $500; For Syrians born in Syria, but who left Syria before reaching the age of 11 and who have resided outside Syria for more than 15 years, the fee for exemption from military service is $5,000; For persons who do not meet the above criteria, but who reside abroad, the fee for exemption from military service is $6,500.",

      "Trade and Sanctions: Since May 11, 2004, measures imposed in accordance with the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act have prohibited the export to Syria of products of the United States other than food or medicine, and prohibit any commercial aircraft owned or controlled by the Syrian government from taking off from or landing in the United States. Under the authority provided in Section 5(b) of the Act, the President has determined that it is in the national security interest of the United States to waive the application of these sanctions in certain cases and for certain products, as specified in the Department of Commerce's General Order No. 2. “For additional information about the exportation of U.S.-origin dual-use items to Syria, consult the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Treasury web sites.”",

      "The Syrian regime has used deadly force to quell anti-government protests and is engaged in a full-scale civil war with armed groups. The government is no longer in control of vast swathes of the country, particularly in northern, southern and eastern Syria and Damascus suburbs. Some armed groups have utilized car bombs, improvised explosive device/indirect-fire attacks, sniper fire, and carried out kidnappings throughout the country. Foreign combatants – including Iranian regime elements, Hizballah fighters, Islamic extremists, and al Qaida-linked elements – are also participating in hostilities. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) controls large amounts of territory in the north and east of the country where it has committed atrocities against civilians, including the murder of U.S. citizens. Syrian regime military operations have involved the use of ballistic missiles, aerial attacks, heavy artillery, and chemical weapons targeting civilian centers. Attacks from the regime or other groups could happen with little or no warning, no part of Syria should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for unpredictable and hostile acts, including kidnappings, sniper assaults, terrorist attacks, large- and small-scale bombings, as well as arbitrary arrest, detention, and torture. The U.S. intelligence community assesses with high confidence that the Asad regime has used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, against the Syrian people multiple times over the past year. ISIL is also likely responsible for several small-scale sulfur mustard attacks in Syria. The continuing violence, deteriorating security situation, and Syria’s continuing chemical and biological weapons program creates a particularly volatile situation. The security situation throughout the country is very likely to remain volatile and unpredictable for the foreseeable future, with some areas, especially in the contested population centers, experiencing substantially increased levels of violence. The conflict has resulted over 400,000 deaths with many thousands more wounded, over 4.8 million refugees and over 6.5 million internally displaced persons. There is an ongoing and increased risk of kidnapping of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a specific target, with several high profile abductions since mid-2012. U.S. citizens held captive by ISIL have been murdered by the group, which released videos of killings and publicly took responsibility for their deaths. U.S. citizens have been abducted by other individuals and groups in Syria, and from various locations, including the Damascus and Aleppo areas. Other U.S. citizens have gone missing and are believed kidnapped since the outbreak of hostilities, from diverse backgrounds ranging from academia and journalism to humanitarian work. The risk for kidnapping is high and persists for U.S. citizens of all backgrounds, in all areas of Syria. A porous border with Iraq and long-standing border issues with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Israel, have contributed to a complex security environment in Syria, compounded by a protracted violent conflict and influx of foreign fighters. Since 2012, there have been multiple reports of Syrian shelling of neighboring countries near border areas, most significantly in Lebanon, Turkey, and the Golan Heights. Indirect fire has crossed into Lebanon on several occasions and Syria-based extremists associated with ISIL and al-Nusrah Front have conducted several incursions into Lebanon, illustrating the continued potential for spillover of Syria’s conflict throughout the region. The Government of Turkey has closed its border with Syria. Border crossings from Syria into Turkey are prohibited, even if the traveler entered Syria from Turkey. Individuals seeking emergency medical treatment or safety from immediate danger are assessed on a case by case basis. Syria has been a State Sponsor of Terrorism since 1979 and has given political support to a variety of terrorist groups affecting the stability of the region. Terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. Terrorists may target areas frequented by Westerners, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and other frequently visited areas. U.S. citizens still in Syria are strongly encouraged to depart Syria immediately. U.S. citizens who choose to remain despite this warning should maintain a high level of vigilance and be aware of their surroundings. It is especially important for travelers to be unpredictable in their movements by varying times and routes and maintaining a low profile.",
      "While many Syrians appear genuinely friendly towards foreigners, underlying tensions can lead to a quick escalation in the potential for violence. Elements within both the regime, as well as non-state actor groups, maintain anti-U.S. or anti-Western sentiment, which may intensify following significant events in the region, particularly those related to U.S.-Syria relations, international intervention in the ongoing conflict, Israeli-Palestinian issues, the status of Jerusalem, and clashes in Lebanon. Security personnel frequently place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, internet connections, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in questioning, detention and/or confiscation of the images. Additionally, U.S. citizens should be aware that conversations on the topics of politics, religion, and other social issues could lead to arrest. It is also illegal in Syria to possess specific-use electronic devices including GPS, short-wave or handheld radio equipment, or similar devices. U.S. citizens should increase their vigilance if they travel to the border area with Iraq or Israel, the Golan Heights, or the Al-Jazira (eastern Syria) region. CRIME: The rate of crime in major Syrian cities is difficult to determine because of the country is currently experiencing a violent civil war. The current unrest and significant deterioration of the Syrian economy have led to a perceived increase in criminal activity. Since the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Damascus in February of 2012, the U.S. government has not been able to provide accurate information about crime to U.S. citizens visiting or living in Syria. The Department of State strongly recommends that U.S. citizens remaining in Syria depart immediately. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.",

The Embassy of the Syrian Arab Republic in Washington, DC, however, suspended all operations, including consular services on March 18, 2014 and has not appointed a protecting power. Foreigners who wish to stay 15 days or more in Syria must register with Syrian immigration authorities by the 15th day of their stay. Syria charges a departure tax at its land and sea borders for all visitors except those on diplomatic passports and children under the age of 11. Israel Travel: The Syrian government rigidly enforces restrictions on prior travel to Israel, and does not allow persons with passports bearing Israeli visas or entry/exit stamps to enter the country. Likewise, the absence of entry stamps from a country adjacent to Israel, which the traveler has just visited, will cause Syrian immigration officials to refuse admittance. Overland entry into Syria directly from Israel is not possible. U.S. citizen travelers suspected of having traveled to Israel have been detained for questioning. Dual Nationality: U.S. males holding dual Syrian citizenship or non-dual U.S. citizen men of Syrian origin, even those born in the United States, may be subject to compulsory military service unless they receive a temporary or permanent exemption from a Syrian diplomatic mission abroad prior to their entry into Syria. Syria usually will not issue visas or residency permits to students wishing to study religion or Arabic in private religious institutions. A child under the age of eighteen whose father is Syrian or of Syrian descent must have his/her father’s permission to leave Syria, even if the parents are separated or divorced and the mother has been granted full custody by a Syrian court. On occasion, the families of U.S.-Syrian women visiting Syria have attempted to prevent them from leaving the country, generally in order to compel the woman to marry. Although under Syrian law a woman does not need her husband's explicit consent every time she wishes to leave Syria, a Syrian husband may take legal action to prevent his wife from leaving the country, regardless of her nationality. Once such legal orders are in place, the U.S. government cannot help U.S. citizens to leave Syria.",

The AIDS test must be conducted in Syria at a facility approved by the Syrian Ministry of Health. A residence permit will not be issued until the applicant is determined HIV negative. Foreigners wishing to marry Syrian nationals in Syria must also be tested for HIV. Please verify this information with the Syrian government before you travel.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Thailand, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. In Thailand, traffic moves on the left, although motorcycles and motorized carts often drive (illegally) against the traffic flow. The city of Bangkok has heavy traffic composed of motorcycles, bicycles, cars, trucks, buses, and three-wheeled tuk-tuks. For safety, if you are walking, use overhead walkways whenever possible and look carefully in both directions before crossing streets, even if using a marked crosswalk with a green &quot;walk&quot; light illuminated. This is particularly true in front of the U.S. Embassy on Bangkok's Wireless Road and on Sukhumvit Road, where many pedestrians have been killed and several U.S. citizens seriously injured while crossing the street. The Embassy has instructed its employees to use the pedestrian bridge to cross the road at all times, and we advise you to do the same anywhere a pedestrian bridge is available. It is common for scooters and motorbikes to “jump the curb” and ride on the sidewalks during rush hour and other periods of thick traffic. Be wary of this phenomenon while walking on the sidewalk in Thai cities.",
      "Traffic accidents are common in Thailand. According to the World Health Organization, in 2013 Thailand had one of the world’s highest traffic-related fatality rates at 38.1 per 100,000 inhabitants (to compare, the United States had 11.4 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants). The accident rate in Thailand is particularly high during long holidays, when alcohol use and traffic are both heavier than normal. During the Songkran (Thai New Year) holiday in April, the problem is exacerbated when people throw water at passing vehicles as part of the traditional celebration. Paved roads, many of them four lanes wide, connect Thailand's major cities. On the country's numerous two-lane roads, slow-moving trucks limit speed and visibility. Speeding, reckless passing, and failure to obey traffic laws are common in all regions of Thailand. Commercial drivers commonly consume alcohol, amphetamines, and other stimulants. Serious bus crashes occur frequently, especially on overnight trips. Scores of foreigners have been killed or injured in bus or transportation van crashes in 2013 and 2014.",
      "Accidents involving motorcycles can be particularly deadly. Every year numerous U.S. citizens die or are seriously injured in accidents while not wearing helmets or proper clothing and footwear when on motorbikes and scooters. The Embassy recommends Embassy staff and family members not use motorcycles (especially motorcycle taxis), mopeds, and tuk-tuks in Bangkok, and we advise you to follow this recommendation as well. Use of motorcycle helmets is mandatory, but this law is seldom enforced. Watch out when opening car doors, even on the curb side. Motorcyclists and bicyclists often try to slip between the curb and stopped or slow-moving cars, and they collide with doors that are being opened. In such cases, you may have to pay for the damages, even if the accident was not your fault.",
      "Congested roads and a scarcity of ambulances can make it difficult for accident victims to receive timely medical attention. Thailand requires that all vehicles be covered by third-party liability insurance for death or injury, but there is no mandatory coverage for property damage. The Embassy encourages its employees to obtain liability insurance coverage over and above the minimum third party liability insurance required by the Thai government. You should consider this as well, as the more affluent driver, even if not at fault, is frequently compelled to cover the expenses of the other party in an accident in Thailand. If you have a traffic accident, you should contact your insurance company for guidance in dealing with the other party and the police.",
      "In Bangkok, the BTS elevated &quot;Skytrain,&quot; “Airport Rail Link” mass transit systems, or the underground MRT system are reliable, inexpensive, air conditioned, and often faster than trying to travel through Bangkok traffic. Bangkok also has an extensive bus system, but buses can be overcrowded and are often driven with little or no regard for passenger safety. Privately operated vans carrying 8-15 passengers have become increasingly popular since 2007, both within Bangkok and to and from other cities. However, these vans are not clearly regulated, the drivers are sometimes reckless and untrained, and it is not always clear who owns and operates the vans. Cities elsewhere in Thailand typically have only rudimentary public transportation and usually do not have metered taxis. In many cases, motorcycle taxis, tuk-tuks, bicycle-powered rickshaws, and pick-up trucks will be the only options available for travelers without their own transport. You should be cautious when using these services, as all of them can be dangerous in fast or heavy traffic.",
      "Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information.",
      "RAIL SAFETY: While millions utilize the State Railway system within Thailand every year, poor track maintenance, outdated equipment and rails, and unmarked train crossings have caused accidents, train derailments, and delays. In 2013 there were a series of train derailments, especially on the Bangkok – Chiang Mai line, some of which resulted in serious injuries to passengers. This situation prompted officials to close down sections of the northern line to Chiang Mai for maintenance. The line reopened on December 1, 2013.",

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Thailand, you are subject to its laws. If you break local laws in Thailand, your U.S. passport won’t help you to avoid arrest or prosecution. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different from our own. For example, as previously mentioned, Thais hold the King and the royal family in the highest regard, and it is a serious criminal offense in Thailand to make critical or defamatory comments about them. This particular crime, called lèse majesté, is punishable by a prison sentence of three to fifteen years. The offenses include actions that in the United States would be sanctioned as the exercise of free speech. If you use the Internet when committing this crime, you may be subject to additional criminal sanctions of up to seven additional years in prison. Thai authorities actively search for and investigate Internet postings, including blog entries and links to other sites, for lèse majesté content. They have arrested and charged U.S. citizens and others with lèse majesté offenses for actions that occurred outside of Thailand. You can also be charged if you do not remove a potentially offensive item fast enough from an Internet site you control. Purposely tearing or destroying Thai bank notes, which carry an image of the King, may also be considered a lèse majesté offense, as can spitting on or otherwise defiling an official uniform bearing the royal insignia.",

Attempts to overthrow foreign governments by force may violate U.S. law as well as Thai law.",

If you are arrested for a minor drug offense, you may be jailed for several weeks while lab testing is done on the drugs seized with you. Pre-trial jail conditions may be more severe than prison conditions. If you are able to post bail during this period, the Royal Thai government will place your name on a watch list for Thai immigration officials because you are not supposed to leave Thailand until the legal proceedings are complete.",
      "Some trekking tour companies, particularly in northern Thailand, make drugs available to trekkers. Drug-related crimes and arrests are also common in Bangkok, Pattaya, and at some beach resorts in southern Thailand. Police in beach resort areas are especially on the lookout for drugs during and after “full moon parties.” You should not accept drugs of any kind, as the drugs may be altered and harmful, and the use or sale of narcotic drugs is illegal in Thailand.",
      "Thai police occasionally raid discos, bars, or nightclubs looking for underage patrons and drug users. During the raids, they typically check the identification of all customers in the establishment and make each person provide a urine sample to be checked for narcotics. The police do not excuse foreigners from these checks, and they arrest and charge anyone whose urine tests positive for drugs. Customers can be jailed if they do not cooperate, and we are unaware of any successful challenge to the practice.",
      "Shoplifting is strictly prosecuted. Arrests for shoplifting even low-value items can result in large fines and lengthy detention followed by deportation. If you are accused of shoplifting at the airport, you will be detained and may miss your flight at your own expense. In 2010 and 2012, there were news reports that duty-free store employees in league with airport police added unpurchased items to foreigners’ check-out bags or did not charge for all the items purchased. Purportedly, police then stopped the foreigner as he/she exited the stores and charged the person with shoplifting. We strongly recommend that before leaving a counter, you carefully check all receipts to make certain they list all the items you purchased and also carefully check to ensure that only the items you purchased are in your bag.",

During the monsoon season from May through October, drowning is the leading cause of death for tourists visiting the resort island of Phuket. Some, but not all beaches have warning flags to indicate the degree of risk (red flag: sea condition dangerous for swimming; yellow flag: sea condition rough, swim with caution; green flag: sea condition stable).",
      "Weather Conditions: Heavy rains and floods are frequent during the May-October rainy season. Be alert for floods and landslides near waterways, in low-lying areas, and along hills. The leading cause of death during 2011’s historic period of flooding was electrocution because people did not turn off electricity in their flooded homes. Long power outages are also common during the rainy season. Monitor local media to keep up to date with the latest information about weather and road conditions in your area. The Thai Meteorological Department posts weather forecasts and warnings online. If you are traveling by ferry, air, bus, or rail during periods of heavy rain, you should check with the transportation company you plan to use to ensure that its service is still operating.

Ferries and speedboats used for transport to and from the many islands off the Thai mainland and along rivers and canals are often overcrowded and do not carry sufficient safety equipment. In November 2013, six people, including three foreigners, died when an overcrowded tourist ferry sank near Pattaya.

      "Arbitration: Incidents involving traffic accidents, minor property damage, and petty crimes are often settled through informal arbitration, or “compromise.” This process usually takes place at a police station, with the police as arbiters and sometimes as participants. It may seem irregular and look like an attempt to fleece the foreigner, but it is a traditional way of settling a dispute that many Thais prefer because it avoids legal formalities and is relatively quick. However, it can be opaque and bewildering to foreigners. In places with a large number of tourists, English-speaking Tourist Police or police volunteers might be able to explain what is going on. In any case, you should not sign anything unless you have read it and understood it. If you are not comfortable with this process, you can decline to participate. The police then will write a report and handle the matter through the formal judicial process. If this happens, you should consult with a local attorney for guidance.",
      "Schools: Thailand has many schools where foreigners may study the Thai language, train to become English teachers, yoga instructors, learn Thai massage, or study Muay Thai, traditional Thai Boxing. Most are reputable, but some U.S. citizens have lost substantial sums of money to unscrupulous school operators who do not provide the services they have promised or do not adhere to current Thai visa and work permit regulations. We do not monitor or evaluate individual schools. You should thoroughly research a school before paying any fees. Do not rely on the website. Visit the school campus to inspect its facilities and verify the credentials of its instructors. Check the school’s reputation online – there are several websites that have student reviews. Paying school fees with a U.S. credit card rather than with cash or a bank transfer will make it easier to recover your money in case of a dispute.",

LGBT groups report that in the case of sexual crimes police tend to downplay sexual abuse or not to take harassment claims from LGBT victims seriously. There are also reports of some continued commercial discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

      "ACCESSIBILITY: While in Thailand, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what they experience in the United States. The Thai constitution mandates that newly constructed buildings have facilities for persons with disabilities. Also, newly built transportation facilities and new transportation equipment must be accessible to the disabled. Enforcement and awareness of these provisions has been gradually increasing since the first related law was passed in 1979, but enforcement is not uniform. Wheelchair access to buildings and public transportation is often difficult, impracticable, or non-existent. Ramps may be excessively steep. Curbs are seldom cut for wheelchairs. Sidewalks can be uneven and congested with vendors, utility poles, and other obstacles. Beginning in 2008, Bangkok began reconstructing sidewalks in commercial areas to make them safer for persons with disabilities. Facilities for the deaf and vision impaired are sparse and designed primarily for readers and speakers of Thai.",

Most targeted attacks are directed at security officials and Thai government interests. Bombings have also struck public and commercial areas. On May 6, 2014, explosions in downtown Hat Yai in Songkhla Province targeted a police station and a 7-Eleven convenience store, injuring ten. On May 24, 2014, three people were killed and 73 injured in multiple bombing attacks in a busy part of Pattani, including at three 7-Eleven convenience stores. The July 25 bombing of a hotel in Betong, Yala—an area popular with Malaysian tourists—killed three people and wounded over 30.

The Department of State urges you to defer non-emergency travel to these areas. If you must travel to these areas, you should exercise special caution and remain vigilant with regard to your personal security.

Between July 2008 and April 2012, soldiers from the two countries exchanged gunfire on several occasions. Some artillery fire reportedly struck several kilometers away from the border. Fighting has also extended some distance along the disputed border in both locations. In 2013, the World Court issued a ruling regarding the disposition of certain lands along the border areas in and around Preah Vihear, but the terms of the ruling have yet to be fully implemented, and residual local tensions remain.

It is possible that significant flare-ups of military activity on the Burmese side of the border could spill over into adjacent areas of northern Thailand. The Department of State recommends that you exercise caution when traveling in remote or rural areas of Thailand adjacent to the Burma border. If you travel off-road in undeveloped areas use local guides who are familiar with the area.

      "CRIME: Although the crime threat in Bangkok and other Thai cities remains lower than that in many U.S. cities, crimes of opportunity such as pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, and burglary are not unusual. You should be especially wary when walking in crowded markets, tourist sites, and bus or train stations. Many U.S. citizens have had passports, wallets, and other valuables stolen in Bangkok's Chatuchak Weekend Market, in the area of Khao San Road, and other tourist areas, usually by pickpockets and thieves who cut into purses or bags with a razor and remove items surreptitiously or who grab purses and bags while speeding past on motorbikes. Across Thailand, U.S. citizens have been robbed of their valuables and other possessions after soliciting the services of commercial sex workers. Thieves also victimize travelers on long-distance bus routes. Police may refuse to issue police reports for foreign victims of theft, requiring them instead to travel several miles to a central Tourist Police station. When requesting a police report, police officers may ask you to pay a small fee of approximately 50 baht.",
      "Violent crimes against foreigners are relatively rare. However, murders, rapes, and assaults do occur. These crimes happen most often at night. Frequently, victims, both male and female, have been drinking and are often alone or separated from travelling companions. These crimes have occurred all over Thailand but are most common in Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai, and tourist areas in southern Thailand, including Phuket, Koh Tao, Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, and Krabi. If you are traveling alone, you should exercise caution, stay near other travelers and ensure that friends or family know how to contact you. Sexually motivated violent incidents, committed by both Thai citizens and visitors, are most likely to occur at parties at discos or beaches, such as the Full Moon party on Phangan Island. Some victims find that Thai authorities do not handle their cases with as much sensitivity or consideration for privacy as they would expect in the United States. You should maintain awareness of your surroundings and travel with trusted friends or relatives to reduce your chances of falling victim to crimes of this nature.",
      "Minor and major incidents of crimes involving taxis or &quot;tuk-tuks&quot; (three-wheeled taxis) can occur, especially in some tourist areas. Drivers may attempt to charge excessive fares at airports and near major tourist attractions. When frequenting bars late at night, you should ensure that you are not alone, as you might be particularly vulnerable to unscrupulous taxi drivers. Before entering a for-hire vehicle, you should either request that the driver use the meter or reach an agreement on the fare for your trip. Taxis in Bangkok and other major cities have meters, and their drivers usually use them. Taxis in tourist areas often do not have meters; negotiate the fare before you get into these taxis. Taxi drivers often refuse fares, especially during rush hour or to places they do not know well. You should be aware that raising your voice and using aggressive body language could be seen as a threat to the driver. Do not hesitate to ask to be let out of a taxi immediately if the driver is acting suspiciously or driving erratically. Registered taxicab drivers have a yellow placard with their name in English and their photograph on the passenger’s side dashboard of the vehicle. If this photograph does not match the driver, you should be wary of entering the vehicle. Police will seldom intervene in incidents involving taxi drivers. Many visitors have used smartphone-based for hire vehicle services such as the international firm Uber, although such services are under legal review.",
      "In Phuket, despite recent efforts by local officials to reduce overcharges to tourists, drivers routinely charge fares that are much higher than those in Bangkok for comparable distances. Threats of violence may accompany excessive charges. Tuk-tuk and taxi drivers in Phuket are frequently described in media reports as being a “mafia.” Local government officials in Phuket have attempted to crack down on these practices and introduced standard fares, with limited success. Drivers have organized against attempts to provide alternative services. For instance, they have blockaded van and bus services during U.S. Navy ship visits. (See also the Special Circumstances and Safety and Road Conditions sections.) To lodge a complaint about an encounter with a taxicab driver, call 1584 (within Thailand).",
      "When arriving at a Thai airport, you should use only public transportation from the airport's official pick-up and drop-off area, cars from the airport limousine counters, or airport buses. Most major hotels can also arrange to have a car and driver meet incoming flights. It is uncommon for Thai taxis to pick up additional passengers. You should be wary of drivers seeking to do so, and you should never enter a cab that has someone besides the driver in it.",
      "You should be aware of a common scam that involves the rental of motorbikes, jet skis, and sometimes cars. Many rental companies require your passport as a deposit or collateral. If there is damage to the rental vehicle, the company often holds the passport until you pay for the damage. The Embassy receives many reports of renters having been charged exorbitant amounts for damage to jet skis or motorbikes, even in instances where the renter had caused no visible damage. A variation of this scam occurs when the motorbike is “stolen,” and the rental agency demands that the renter pay two or three times the price of the motorbike to replace it. For this reason, you should be cautious about rental arrangements and not use your passport as a deposit or collateral. You should be certain to examine the vehicle and note any pre-existing damage before operating the vehicle. If possible, document the vehicle’s condition with before and after photos. If you purchase insurance from the rental shop, be sure you know what the insurance policy covers, and get a receipt showing you paid for insurance. If you find yourself a victim of one of these scams, you will need to make an attempt to recover your passport by involving the local Royal Thai Police and Tourist Police and documenting the situation with a police report. Note that the Embassy cannot intervene in personal financial disputes; however, you can apply for a new passport at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General if you have not recovered your passport.",
      "Scams involving gems, city tours, entertainment venues, and credit cards are common, especially in areas heavily visited by tourists. Taxi and tuk-tuk drivers, among others, commonly tout gem stores, entertainment venues, or alternate tours. These touts receive kickbacks or commissions that drive up the prices of the goods or services, and you should not accept tours or other offers from them. You should consider exiting the vehicle to seek a different means of transportation if you feel uncomfortable. You should use credit cards only in reputable, established businesses, and you should check the amount you have been charged for accuracy.",
      "The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) receives over a thousand complaints each year from visitors who have been cheated on gem purchases. Scams usually follow a predictable pattern. Someone approaches you outside of a well-known tourist attraction such as the Grand Palace and says that the attraction is closed. The friendly stranger gains your confidence and suggests a visit to a temple that is supposedly open only one day per year; the stranger then mentions in passing that a special once-a-year government-sponsored gem sale is going on and directs you to a waiting tuk-tuk. At the temple, another stranger -- sometimes a foreigner-- engages you in conversation and also mentions the &quot;special&quot; gem sale. You agree to go look at the gem shop and are soon convinced to buy thousands of dollars’ worth of jewels that you can supposedly sell in the United States for a 100 percent profit. In fact, the gems turn out to be of much less value than you paid for them, and the shop does not honor its money-back guarantee. No matter what a tout may say, no jewelry stores are owned, operated, or sponsored by the Thai government or by the Thai royal family. You can find detailed information on gem scams on numerous websites. If you fall victim to a gem scam, you should contact the local branch of the Tourist Police or call their toll-free number: 1155.",

To protect yourself from such scams, do not engage in activities that would put you in a vulnerable position, such as soliciting sex or purchasing or using illegal drugs.",
      "A variation commonly reported in Bangkok’s Khao San Road area involves “mistakenly” purchasing “prescription” drugs from a pharmacy.

The Thai Criminal Code does not provide police authority to impose a fine over 1,000 baht. Only a court can impose a larger fine.

      "Thailand, officially the Royal Kingdom of Thailand and formerly known as Siam, is a Southeast Asian nation at the center of the Indochina peninsula with a population of nearly 70 million. It is a popular travel destination with tourist facilities available throughout much of the country. Bangkok is the capital city and Chiang Mai is an important educational and cultural center in northern Thailand. Thailand is a constitutional monarchy with the King as head of state and the prime minister as head of government. The monarchy is an integral and respected part of Thai society and is protected by a vigorously enforced lèse majesté law that makes it a crime to commit any offense or insult against the royal family. On May 22, 2014, the Royal Thai Army seized control of the government, voided the 2007 Constitution, and established the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) to oversee Thailand’s interim government. The military intervention had been preceded by months of anti-government protests. Nationwide martial law, enacted in May 2014, was lifted April 1, 2015, and replaced with new security measures that give authorities broad latitude to act against perceived threats to political stability, the economy, or the monarchy, and explicitly bans demonstrations. Martial law remains in effect in Thailand’s Deep South, where it was imposed in 2005. Political and civil unrest have perennially affected Thailand, and in some cases disrupted travel into, out of, and within Bangkok. Read the Department of State’s Fact Sheet on Thailand for additional information on U.S.-Thailand relations."

      "Road Conditions and Safety : While some major thoroughfares in urban parts of Togo are paved, many secondary streets are not, and they can become severely flooded when it rains. Driving conditions are hazardous throughout Togo due to the presence of pedestrians, large swarms of small motorcycles, disorderly drivers (moped, car and truck drivers), livestock on the roadways, and the poor condition of the roads, which often contain deep potholes. Overland travel off the main network of roads generally requires a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Nighttime travel is dangerous, and it is inadvisable to drive outside urban centers after dark. Even when driving in the city, keep car doors locked and the windows up. You should be aware of your surroundings and drive defensively. Traffic Laws : Many drivers in Togo do not obey traffic laws and most traffic signals do not function properly. You should be prepared for the possibility that other drivers may run red lights or stop signs or drive in the wrong direction on one-way streets. At official checkpoints, Togolese security officials prefer that you approach with your interior lights on, headlights dimmed, and have your driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance ready. We recommend that you carry copies of important documents such as your passport and driver’s license to provide to authorities rather than handing over your originals. Typically, a person involved in an accident should assist the other party(ies) if involved in an accident, unless it is not safe to do so. Since crowds can form easily following even a minor accident, it is very important to maintain attentiveness to the situation and ensure that the police are notified to respond to the scene as soon as possible. We do not recommended paying any fee (bribe) to police or other authorities for them to perform their work, or to avoid sanctions. Driving can be haphazard and disorderly, particularly in crowded city centers. Public Transportation : You are advised to exercise caution when using any form of local public transportation, particularly moto-taxis. Never get into a taxi with unknown passengers and always agree on the fare before getting in. See our Road Safety page for more information. Aviation Safety Oversight: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Togo’s Civil Aviation Authority as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Togo’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page . However, Ethiopian Airlines has established direct flights between Newark and Lomé.",

Drivers often fail to obey the rules of the road even in the presence of police. Traffic signs and signals are often ignored, and drivers sometimes drive vehicles on the wrong side of the road. Defensive driving is a must in Tunisia. Faster drivers tend to drive on the left while slower drivers stay to the right. Traffic lane markings are widely ignored. Drivers may be stopped for inspection by police officers within cities and on highways at any time, and drivers should comply. Bicycles, mopeds, and motorcycles are operated without sufficient lights or reflectors, making them difficult to see darting in and out of traffic. Motorists should also be aware of animals on the roads, particularly in rural areas.",
      "Traffic Laws : Drivers should be aware that if they are involved in a motor accident that results in death or serious injury of another person, the police may take them into protective custody until they are absolved of responsibility. This can mean spending up to several months in detention. As with any arrest or detention, U.S. citizens taken into custody should immediately request that the police inform the Embassy of their whereabouts.",
      "Pedestrians and Cyclists: If you are a pedestrian or cyclist in Tunisia, you should be aware that drivers rarely yield and will not always stop at either crosswalks or stoplights.",
      "Public Transportation: Exercise caution when using public transportation, due to safety and security concerns. Buses and trains can be crowded, and pickpocketing is not uncommon.",
      "Desert Travel:",
      "Travel in the desert areas of southern Tunisia presents additional challenges, as many roads are not paved and even well-traveled routes are subject to blowing sands that can create hazards for vehicles. Persons driving off the major paved roads are encouraged to ensure that their vehicles are appropriate for off-road driving conditions and are equipped with appropriate spares and supplies, including water and food. Groups should travel in multiple vehicles, so if a vehicle becomes disabled or immobilized, the group can return in the operable vehicle(s). Desert regions are subject to extreme temperatures, from sub-freezing evenings in the winter to dangerously hot daytime temperatures in the summer. There are many areas in the southern desert regions with little or no cellular telephone service. The Tunisian National Guard encourages persons traveling into the desert to register their travel beforehand.

      "All traffic operates on the left side of the road, and most vehicles use right-hand drive. Roads are often poorly maintained, and four-wheel drive may be required in some areas. Sparse or non-existent lighting and poor road conditions make driving at night hazardous. Driving in Dili is especially hazardous, with large trucks and military vehicles sharing the streets with vendors, pedestrians, and livestock. Many cars and, especially, motorcycles operate at night without lights. Taxis, small buses, and mini-vans provide public transportation in Dili and elsewhere. However, public transportation is generally overcrowded, uncomfortable, and below international safety standards. Public transportation operators have been known to unexpectedly drop passengers at locations other than their destination due to the operators’ fears about certain areas or hours. Disagreement about fares has occasionally led to hostilities. Public transport is generally inadvisable and is generally unavailable after dark, although taxis are occasionally available at select locations. During the rainy season from November to May, rain showers can severely damage cross-island roadways, making roads particularly risky. You should use caution when traveling on the cross-island roadways in the mountain areas of Aileu, Ermera, Manatuto, Ainaro, and Manufahi districts. Accidents occur frequently. When there is an accident, you should contact the police. Bystanders sometimes attack the driver perceived to be responsible for a traffic accident. T his is more common in rural areas and in accidents involving Timorese drivers, but crowds have occasionally attacked foreign drivers at the scene of an accident. If you are involved in an accident and believe that there is a threat of bodily harm from people at the scene of the accident, it is advisable to drive to the nearest police station before stopping.",

      "Decades of occupation and periodic eruptions of post-independence violence have left Timor-Leste with extremely poor infrastructure and limited economic opportunities. Electricity, telephone and telecommunications, roads, and lodging remain unreliable, particularly outside of the capital. Timor-Leste's economy relies largely on revenues from offshore oil and gas production. Read the Department of State's Fact Sheet on U.S.-Timor-Leste relations."

Highways in the tourist-frequented western, southwestern, and coastal regions of Turkey are generally in good condition and are well maintained, while conditions in other areas vary.",
      "Be extremely cautious while driving at night. We recommend that you not drive after dark outside of major cities. Some local drivers drive without their lights on or with very low lights, making it difficult to see them. It is not unusual to find hazardous objects in roadways such as dead animals, large rocks, missing sewer covers, deep holes, or objects that have fallen from vehicles. Live farm animals can also be found near or in the roadway in rural areas. In case of an accident or car trouble :",
      "Follow precautionary measures as you would in the United States for car trouble: pull to the side of the road, turn on hazard lights, and use reflector triangles. For accidents with only vehicular damage, exchange insurance information, take photos of the accident before moving the vehicles, and depart if both sides agree. Turkish law requires drivers to fill out a Turkish-only form and provide pictures of the damage. Non-Turkish speakers should call and wait for the police. For accidents with injury or a disagreement, remain at the site of the accident. Do not move the vehicle - even out of the way - until the Traffic Police arrive. Reported the accident to the Traffic Police (dial 155) or Jandarma (dial 156). Get a certified copy of the official report from the Traffic Police office (this can take several days). The owner of the damaged vehicle should also apply to the customs authority with his passport and accident report before attempting to repair the vehicle or leave the country without it. When in doubt, it is best to call the Traffic Police or the Jandarma in the event of an accident.",

For stays longer than one year: You will need to obtain a Turkish driver’s license from the Turkish Security Directorate, Traffic Department (Emniyet Müdürlüğü, Trafik Hizmetleri Başkanlığı). A vehicle can be brought into Turkey for up to 6 months. Find information at the Turkish Touring and Automobile Club .",
      "Public Transportation: Turkey has a broad public transportation system including taxis, subways, ferries, high-speed trains, buses and local mini-buses ( dolmus ). In certain cities, the interconnecting system of buses, subways, and commuter rails are comparable to those in major U.S. cities.",

Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs are very strict, and include h eavy fines and jail sentences between four and twenty years. Insulting the State: It is illegal to show disrespect to the name or image of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk or to insult the Turkish Government, flag, or security forces. Religious proselytizing: Although there is no law against religious proselytizing, some activities can lead to your arrest. Read the State Department’s International Religious Freedom Report. Cultural artifacts: Turkish law has a broad definition of &quot;antiquities&quot; and makes it a crime to remove any from the country. If you buy antiquities, use authorized dealers and get museum certificates for each item. Failure to have a receipt and certificate at departure can result in your arrest and jail time. Contact the Embassy of Turkey in Washington for specific information regarding customs requirements. Dual citizenship: U.S.-Turkish dual nationals may be subject to laws that impose special obligations on Turkish citizens. Male dual citizens over the age of 18 may be subject to Turkish conscription and compulsory military service. Consult officials at Turkish Embassies or Consulates before entering Turkey with any questions. Turkish authorities may not inform U.S. officials of dual nationals arrested in Turkey or may refuse to allow U.S. officials to visit or provide consular assistance to U.S.-Turkish dual nationals arrested in Turkey. Counterfeit goods: Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if widely available. They are both illegal to bring back into the United States and to purchase locally.",
      "Faith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report .",
      "LGBTI Travelers: Homophobia, transphobia, and intolerance towards homosexuality continue to be widespread throughout Turkey. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals are not protected by anti-discrimination laws and have been the targets of violence in recent years. While the Turkish constitution forbids discrimination against LGBTI individuals, references in the law relating to “offenses against public morality,” “protection of the family,” and “unnatural sexual behavior,” are sometimes used as a basis for abuse by law enforcement officials. In addition, the law states that “no association may be founded for purposes against law and morality,” a clause which has been used by authorities in attempts to shut down or limit the activities of associations working on LGBTI matters.",
      "See our LGBTI travel information page and section six of the Department of State's Human Rights Report for further details.",
      "Persons with Disabilities: The Turkish constitution prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of state services, employment, education, and access to health care, and the government generally enforces the law. Access to buildings and public transportation for the disabled in most cities is quite limited . While some accessible hotels and restaurants exist in tourist destinations, in general, accessibility for people with disabilities in Turkey is poor. Turkish airports and metro stations are generally accessible for the disabled, but other forms of public transportation, such as buses are not. Roads and footpaths are frequently under construction and may contain extensive obstructions. Students: See our students abroad page and FBI travel tips .",

Terrorists have previously attacked U.S. interests in Turkey, including the U.S. Embassy in Ankara and the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul. As stated in the most recent Turkey travel warning , additional attacks in Turkey at major events, tourist sites, restaurants, commercial centers, places of worship, and transportation hubs, including aviation services, metros, buses, bridges, bus terminals and sea transport, could occur.",
      "On October 29, 2016, the Department of State updated its Travel Warning for Turkey to notify U.S. citizens of increased threats of terrorism throughout Turkey, encourage citizens to avoid travel to southeastern Turkey, and advise of the Department of State’s decision to order departure for U.S. Government family members of employees posted to U.S. Consulate General Istanbul. On November 22, 2016, the Department of State extended ordered departure for Consulate General Istanbul through December 27, 2016. These decisions were made as a result of the Department of State’s ongoing assessment of security conditions in Turkey and in recognition of the threat environment in southeastern Turkey.",
      "In addition, the ongoing state of emergency has expanded Turkish security forces’ legal ability to detain individuals without charge from a maximum of four days to a maximum of 30 days. It also expands security forces’ authority in stopping, searching, and validating identification documents. Those stopped without a passport or identity document are subject to a fine or imprisonment. Travelers may also see an increase in police or military activity and restrictions on movement. Delays or denial of consular access to U.S. citizens detained or arrested by security forces, some of whom also possess Turkish citizenship, have occurred.",

Exercise caution and good judgment, keep a low profile, and remain vigilant with regard to your personal security. Do not accept letters, parcels, or other items from strangers for delivery either inside or outside of Turkey. Avoid demonstrations, which may become violent and unpredictable. Obey the instructions of Turkish security personnel at all times.",
      "Known terrorist groups active in Turkey include:",
      "Da’esh , also referred to as The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) , has a significant presence in northern Syria and along portions of the Turkish/Syrian border. Foreign terrorist fighters have been known to travel through Turkey to Syria and Iraq. Although Da’esh has not officially claimed responsibility for any attacks in Turkey, the group has been implicated in numerous recent attacks, including suicide-bombings in Ankara (October 2015), Istanbul’s Sultanahmet (January 2016) and Taksim (March 2016) areas, and a small arms and suicide bombing attack at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport (June 2016). The Kurdistan People's Congress (also known as Kongra Gel or KGK, better known as the Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK) has been the most active terrorist organization in Turkey, targeting Turkish government facilities and infrastructure. Beginning in 2015, the PKK resumed widespread attacks against Turkish security forces throughout Turkey and blockaded and attempted to take control of certain neighborhoods in the southeast. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), also known as the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks or the Kurdistan Liberation Hawks, presents itself as a splinter of the PKK and has taken responsibility for numerous attacks against civilians in major urban areas, including the December 2015 attack at Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen Airport, February 2016 and March 2016 car bombings in Ankara, and a suicide bombing in Istanbul in June 2016. The Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) is known to target both Turkish and U.S. facilities, including detonating a suicide bomb at U.S. Embassy Ankara in 2013 and shooting at the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul in August 2015. The DHKP/C has stated its intention to commit further attacks against Turkey, NATO, and the United States. While al-Qaida, or its splinter group Jabhat al-Nusra (JAN), maintains a presence in Turkey, it has not staged attacks recently. However, groups and individuals inspired by al-Qaida might attempt to do so, placing U.S. and Turkish interests at risk. Turkish authorities believe the Syrian-based Mukaveme Suriyyi (Syrian Resistance) was behind the two largest 2013 terrorist attacks in Turkey.",
      "There have also been instances of religious violence targeting individuals in Turkey working as missionaries (which is severely restricted in Turkey) or viewed as having proselytized for a non-Islamic religion. Threats and actual instances of crime have targeted Christian and Jewish individuals, groups, institutions, and places of worship in Turkey, including several high-profile murders of Christians over the last decade. The level of anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic sentiment remains significant. We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens avoid southeastern Turkey, especially areas close to the Syrian border. The Government of Turkey has closed its border with Syria. Border crossings from Syria into Turkey are prohibited even if the traveler entered Syria from Turkey. Individuals seeking emergency medical treatment or safety from immediate danger are assessed on a case by case basis.",
      "The following incidents have taken place in southeastern Turkey:",
      "Terrorist attacks: Terrorist groups, including Da’esh and the PKK, have conducted large-scale attacks in the area, including suicide bombings, ambushes, and the detonation of car bombs, improvised explosive devices, and other homemade weapons. The PKK has attacked Turkish military and police personnel in the southeastern provinces, occasionally harming innocent bystanders. Terrorist travel: Members of Da’esh and other Islamic extremist terrorist groups travel between Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, possibly bringing with them weapons and explosives. Kidnapping for ransom: Various terrorist organizations continue to finance their operations through kidnapping for ransom operations, especially near Turkey’s southeastern border. Take precaution in any meetings with individuals claiming to be directly involved with any side of the Syrian conflict or purporting to raise funds for assistance to Syria. These precautions include conducting all meetings in public places. Shootings: Turkish towns located along the border with Syria have been struck by bullets and artillery rounds that originate in Syria, some resulting in deaths or injuries. Road blocks: Use commercial air travel whenever possible while traveling to southeastern Turkey. If road travel is necessary, drive only during daylight hours and on major highways. The Turkish Jandarma (military police) and police forces monitor checkpoints on roads in this region. Cooperate if stopped at a checkpoint. Be prepared to provide identification and vehicle registration. Remain calm, do not make any sudden movements, and obey all instructions. We strongly discourage the use of public transportation in the southeastern region. Demonstrations: Violent clashes have taken place between Syrian refugees and Turkish citizens, either in organized demonstrations or as a result of a perceived provocation. Restricted access: Turkish security forces control access to the southeastern provinces of Sirnak, Hakkâri, and Mardin along the Iraqi border. Do not photograph or video Turkish military operations or installations anywhere in Turkey. Curfews: The Turkish Government has instituted temporary curfews in cities throughout the southeast due to blockades of certain neighborhoods by the PKK. Be sure to adhere to any locally imposed curfews.",

      "Common street crimes, such as pick pocketing, purse snatching, and mugging. Carry only necessary items when in tourist areas. Carry a copy of your passport and visa with you, and leave your U.S. passport in your hotel safe. Residential crime occurs more often in major cities, with criminals targeting ground floor apartments for theft. Sexual assault usually occurs while visiting Turkish baths ( hamams ) or spas or when traveling alone at night. Assaults involving date rape drugs have also been reported. Confidence schemes where travelers are tricked into ordering food or drinks at a restaurant and then charged incredibly high prices occur. Patronize well-established restaurants andask to see a menu with prices before ordering anything. Scams are common in Turkey, particularly internet scams involving people who met online. Typically, the person in Turkey asks the other person to wire large sums of money to provide financial assistance. Do not send money to someone you have never met in person. Also exercise due diligence when purchasing jewelry, rugs, or real estate. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Hitchhiking is neither common nor recommended, especially for lone females.",

Dirt roads are common, even in large cities. Vehicles will often enter oncoming traffic to pass or maneuver around obstacles. Broken-down vehicles may be abandoned on the road. Rural roads outside of major arteries are often in poor condition and roadside assistance is not available. Some rural roads are impassible in the rainy season. Livestock and children may dart onto the road without warning. Road travel at night is especially dangerous and should be avoided. At night, there is a high volume of truck traffic passing through the country, and pedestrians, bicycles, and donkey carts pose a major hazard on unlit, unmarked roads. Vehicles are often dangerously overloaded and poorly maintained. Drivers, including motorcyclists and bicyclists, are at times careless. The police rarely enforce traffic laws and are virtually absent from rural roads. Emergency services in case of accidents are scarce, underequipped, and practically nonexistent in most rural areas.

      "U.S. citizens traveling to, or residing in, Burkina Faso should exercise caution and maintain a high level of security awareness at all times. Violent crimes such as roadside banditry, robbery, and rape sometimes occur in Burkina Faso, especially in remote and border areas.",
      "Roadside banditry is a primary concern for local law enforcement, and a problem that exists country-wide. Several recent noteworthy events help illustrate the threat. On October 10, 2013, a U.S. citizen reported that she was robbed by bandits while traveling from Pissila to Kaya. The vehicle came under fire and the driver pulled over after gunshots struck the windshield. Two armed bandits ordered the passengers to exit the vehicle and lie on the ground. The gunmen searched the personal belongings of the passengers and took money and valuables before departing. On December 27, 2013, a group of armed men attacked a vehicle carrying Burkina Faso’s most famous athlete, soccer star Alain Traoré, on the route between Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, near Boromo. On the same day and in the same vicinity, a Swiss government official was shot when the driver of his vehicle refused to stop for armed bandits. These incidents drew special attention because of their high-profile victims, but they are not unusual in terms of the planning that accompanied them or the outcome. Bandits often use spotters at highway checkpoints and bus stations, to profile and identify the traveling route of potential victims. While bandits mainly steal valuables, it is not uncommon for them to physically harm victims during the course of a robbery. According to data from the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security, armed attacks increased significantly in 2012 and 2013. Highway attacks rose from 104 in 2011 to 375 in 2012, an increase of 260 percent, and then to 509 in 2013, rising another 36 percent. It should be noted that many incidents go unreported.",
      "The East region, one of 13 administrative regions, recorded the most armed incidents by far in 2012 and 2013. The region, which borders Niger, Benin, and Togo, was the site of more than a third of total attacks in each of those years. The East region is particularly vulnerable due to its large geographical area and sparse population, and cross-border traffic providing some tempting targets. The Center-East, Center-North and Center-West regions, which include highways out of Ouagadougou to other population centers, also saw marked increases in bandit activity in 2012, and these increases were sustained in 2013.",
      "Newspaper reports from 2014 indicate that while the East region again had the highest number of incidents, banditry occurred throughout several regions and continues to be a country-wide problem.",
      "U.S citizens should avoid travelling on roads at night, particularly in regions with high numbers of incidents. When possible, follow a police convoy or seek local support.",
      "U.S. citizens should exercise caution when traveling along the northern areas of the country near the Mali and Niger borders. On April 4, 2015, a Romanian national was kidnapped and two Burkinabe wounded in an attack by an unidentified armed group at the Tambao manganese mining site, in Northern Burkina Faso near the Mali and Niger borders.",
      "The Sahel Reserve region of Burkina Faso is extremely remote, and the ability of both the Government of Burkina Faso and the U.S. Embassy to render assistance in the event of an emergency there is limited. The U.S. Embassy has placed restrictions on official government travel to Dori, Djibo, the road that connects these cities, and all areas north of that road.",
      "Burkina Faso shares a border with Mali. On January 11, 2013, the French military launched operations against terrorist groups that had taken control of northern Mali. Since that time, terrorist groups have stepped up their rhetoric calling for additional attacks or kidnappings against Westerners, particularly against those countries which support international military intervention in Mali. The al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) terrorist organization and their affiliates could therefore target Westerners in Burkina Faso, especially in the regions of the north near Mali and Niger.",
      "Burkina Faso experienced large-scale demonstrations and civil unrest from October 21 to November 2, 2014, during which time there were incidents of violence, looting, road blockages, tire burning, and destruction of property throughout the capital city of Ouagadougou, in Bobo-Dioulasso, and in other parts of the country. On October 31, 2014, Burkina Faso’s former President Compaore resigned, after crowds looted and burned the National Assembly and other government buildings and residences. Martial law was declared, a curfew installed, and the airport and land borders were temporarily closed. Burkina Faso’s new interim President, Michel Kafando, was sworn in on November 18, 2014 for a 12-month transitional period. Kafando formed a transitional government. Elections are expected to take place in October 2015. Spontaneous demonstrations will likely continue to occur with little to no advance warning throughout Burkina Faso. Instances may arise where the best, safest course of action is to shelter temporarily in place. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant and utilize appropriate personal security practices, including: avoiding large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations; maintaining situational awareness and exercise good judgment; remaining alert and aware of your surroundings; and staying abreast of the situation through media outlets.",

      "CRIME: Crime in Burkina Faso poses some measure of risk for visitors.",
      "Recent incidents of violent crime against visitors have included shooting, armed robbery, sexual assault, and rape. Non-violent crimes directed against visitors have included harassment, theft, burglary, and various confidence scams. Most reported incidents involve purse-snatchers, pickpockets, and street scam artists who target wallets, jewelry, cell phones, and other valuables. Passing thieves on motorbikes or in vehicles have stolen bags from pedestrians. If you must carry a bag, consider holding it in your hand rather than strapped over your shoulder, so you will not be seriously injured if someone grabs it forcefully. Thieves are especially active during international meetings or events which draw large crowds to the capital. The areas near and around the U.N. Circle, Avenue Kwame N’Krumah, and the Central Market in Ouagadougou experience the highest incidence of street crime targeting foreigners. Travelers should stay alert, remain in groups, and avoid poorly lit areas. Be especially cautious at night, when most reported incidents have taken place, but be aware that there have also been incidents in the daytime. Several attacks have been directed at intercity public buses, and these attacks typically take place during the day. It is best to check the U.S. Embassy website for the latest security information before setting out on your journey.",
      "Perpetrators of business fraud often target foreigners, including U.S. citizens. Recent scams that have victimized U.S. citizens have taken many forms, including fraudulent transactions for gold and antiquities. Such fraud schemes are now prevalent throughout West Africa, including Burkina Faso. The scams pose a danger of both financial loss and physical harm. A typical indicator of a business scam is the demand for advance payments on contracts. Persons contemplating business deals in Burkina Faso should contact the commercial section of the U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou if they have any doubts about the legitimacy of a potential business client or partner.",
      "Normally, fraud schemes begin with an unsolicited communication (usually by e-mail) from an unknown individual who describes a situation that promises quick financial gain, often by assisting in the transfer of a large sum of money or gold dust out of the country. A series of &quot;advance fees&quot; must then be paid in order to conclude the transaction. In fact, the final payoff does not exist; the purpose of the scam is simply to collect the advance fees. Common variations of this scheme involve individuals claiming to be refugees, victims of various African conflicts, or former political leaders in need of help in transferring large sums of money. Sometimes perpetrators manage to induce victims to provide bank account and credit card information, as well as financial authorizations that allow them to incur large debts against the victim’s credit. In some instances, victims have lost their life savings.",
      "The best way to avoid becoming a victim of advance-fee fraud is common sense. If a proposition looks too good to be true, it probably is. Research thoroughly any unsolicited business proposal originating from Burkina Faso or any other source before committing funds, providing goods or services, or undertaking travel.",

      "CRIME: Street crime is common throughout Montevideo and criminals may resort to violence when the victims resist. Common targets for criminals may include, tourists, individuals openly carrying valuable items, and motorists in unlocked vehicles stopped at busy intersections, including Montevideo's riverfront road known as the Rambla. So called “smash and grab” robberies, during which a perpetrator will come up to a car stopped at a light or in traffic and break a window in order to steal high value items such as purses, laptops and cell phones, are increasingly common.",
      "You should exercise reasonable caution to minimize your exposure to crime. Criminals are opportunists and prey on unwary people, particularly those carrying cameras, pocketbooks, laptops, or backpacks. Lock your valuables in secure hotel safes and empty your wallets of excess credit cards and cash. If dining at an outdoor restaurant, keep an eye on your belongings at all times. While driving, it is best to keep all car doors locked; windows rolled up, and purses, bags, briefcases, and other valuables out of sight, preferably in the trunk. Parked cars, have also been broken into.",

All foreign nationals are required to obtain valid registration by their third day in Uzbekistan (excluding Sundays and national holidays). From the date of the initial registration, travelers are responsible for maintaining uninterrupted registration, and the initial three-day grace period no longer applies for subsequent moves. This means travelers must apply for registration at the new residence in advance of their intended move. The three-day grace period does not apply to tourist visa holders, who must register at a hotel as soon as they arrive in Uzbekistan. Therefore, it is important to apply for this registration as soon as possible to avoid a fine and other penalties. Registration fees vary depending on length of stay, ranging from USD $20 for a one-month stay to USD $200 for a stay of up to a year. Visitors without proper registration are subject to fines, imprisonment, and deportation; the fines range from USD $1,000 to USD $12,000.",

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Venezuela, U.S. citizens will encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Driving regulations in Venezuela are similar to those in the United States, although many drivers do not obey them. Defensive driving is a necessity. Motorcyclists often weave in and out of lanes and cars. Child car seats and seatbelts are not required and are seldom available in rental cars and taxis. Some Caracas municipalities have outlawed the use of hand held cell phones while driving.",
      "Outside the major cities, night driving can be dangerous because of unmarked road damage or repairs in progress, unlighted vehicles, and livestock. Even in urban areas, road damage is often marked by a pile of rocks or sticks left by passersby near or in the pothole or crevice, without flares or other devices to highlight the danger. Severe flooding, construction projects, traffic accidents, and other such disruptive occurrences can shut down primary and secondary roads for long periods of time, and detours are often not well-marked or easy to follow. Traffic jams are common within Caracas during most of the day and are frequently exploited by criminals.",
      "Armed motorcycle gangs often operate in traffic jams and tend to escape easily. Cases of armed robbery by motorcyclists and theft of other motorcycles have increased and may result in death if the victim does not comply. Stops at National Guard and local police checkpoints are mandatory. Drivers should follow all National Guard instructions and be prepared to show vehicle and insurance papers and passports. Vehicles may be searched. Inexpensive bus service is available to most destinations throughout the country, but the high incidence of criminal activity on public transportation makes bus travel inadvisable. Peak holiday travel occurs during summer and winter school breaks and major civil and religious holidays, including Carnival, Easter, Christmas, and New Year's holidays. Lengthy delays due to road congestion are common during these peak periods.",

      "Medical care at private hospitals and clinics in Caracas and other major cities is generally adequate. Public, government-funded hospitals and clinics generally provide a lower level of care and basic supplies at public facilities may be in short supply or unavailable. Cash payment is usually required in advance of the provision of medical services at private facilities, although some facilities will accept credit cards. Patients who cannot provide advance payment may be referred to a public hospital for treatment. Private companies that require the patient to be a subscriber to the service or provide cash payment in advance generally provide the most effective ambulance services. Public ambulance service is unreliable. U.S. citizens should be aware that, due to the currency restrictions in effect in Venezuela, they might find it difficult to receive wire transfers from abroad, whether through a bank or Western Union. Wire transfers cannot be used reliably as a source of emergency funds. U.S. citizens traveling to Venezuela may also find it difficult to obtain certain prescription drugs as well as certain over the counter medications such as analgesics, particularly name brands, and should ensure that they have sufficient quantities of all medications for the duration of their stay.",
      "Dengue fever is common in Venezuela, as it is in other tropical and subtropical parts of the world. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness. There is no vaccine available for prevention, and there is no specific treatment available. Typical symptoms are fever, pain behind the eyes, rash and body aches. More serious cases involving bleeding and shock do occur; the fatality rate is one or two per ten thousand cases. Seek medical care if you believe you exhibit flu-like symptoms after exposure to mosquito bites. Avoiding mosquito bites by using insect repellant or clothing to cover skin is the best prevention.",
      "Zika Virus: Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact. The CDC has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects in some fetuses and babies born to infected mothers. For additional information about Zika, including travel advisories, visit the CDC website .",
      "Chagas disease also occurs in Venezuela and in other parts of South America. Chagas is a parasitic disease carried by the triatomine insect or &quot;kissing bug&quot; or &quot;chipo,&quot; as it is called in Venezuela. It is difficult to treat and can cause permanent heart damage and lead to death. The Pan American Health Organization estimates that 1,500 new cases of the illness are recorded in Venezuela each year and that 789 people die from the disease every year. It is uncommon for travelers to contract Chagas disease, but those staying in older adobe and thatch buildings or sleeping out in the open are at risk. In Venezuela, Chagas disease occurs mostly in the rural states of Trujillo, Lara, Portuguesa, and Barinas, but cases have been reported throughout the entire country and sporadic outbreaks occur in Caracas. It can be transmitted either through the bite of the &quot;chipo&quot; or through ingestion of food contaminated with the insect's feces. Outbreaks in Caracas have been traced to non-commercially prepared fruit juices. Symptoms vary and are often undetectable, but when symptoms occur they often include fever, fatigue, body aches, diarrhea, and vomiting. Those experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately. Avoiding insect bites by using insect repellant or clothing to cover skin is the best prevention.",
      "Malaria is present throughout the states of Amazonas, Bolivar, and Delta Amacuro, and rural areas of certain municipalities within the states of Sucre and Monagas. Chemoprophylaxis with atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine is recommended in addition to insect precautions.",
      "Chikungunya, another mosquito borne viral illness, is also prevalent in Venezuela. There is no vaccine for this condition and treatment is supportive care. Symptoms typically last from three to five days and include joint pain, rash, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Lab abnormalities may be identified in cases of severe disease. The mosquito that transmits this virus is active both during the day and in the evening. It is therefore important to take precautions with the use of insect repellants and long sleeves and pants.",
      "Leishmaniasis, another insect-borne parasitic disease, is present in some areas. Insect precautions are recommended.",

      "CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Venezuela, you are subject to its laws even if you are a U.S. citizen. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different than our own. In some places you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you. For example, in Venezuela it is illegal to take pictures of sensitive installations to include the presidential palace, military bases, government buildings, and airports. Just as in the United States, driving under the influence can land you immediately in jail.",
      "There are also acts that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. You can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you buy pirated goods. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime prosecutable in the United States . Drug trafficking is a serious problem in Venezuela and treated as such by Venezuelan authorities. Convicted traffickers receive lengthy prison sentences, usually eight to ten years. If you do something illegal in Venezuela, your U.S. passport won’t help. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not where you are going.",
      "Security within Venezuela’s prisons is lax to nonexistent. Prison populations are largely under the control of prison gangs with little or no interference from prison authorities. Drugs and weapons are freely available, and prison authorities generally do not provide even basic protections and amenities, including food, so individual prisoners must deal with gang leaders through payments or other mechanisms just to survive. U.S. citizens incarcerated in Venezuelan prisons claim to have been beaten and had their medication withheld.",
      "Based on the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, bilateral agreements with certain countries, and customary international law, if you are arrested in Venezuela, you have the option to request that the police, prison officials, or other authorities alert the nearest U.S. embassy of your arrest and to have communications from you forwarded to the nearest U.S. embassy.",
      "Consular Access: Although Venezuela is a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Venezuelan government sometimes fails to notify the U.S. Embassy when U.S. citizens are arrested, and/or delays or denies consular access to arrestees. Therefore, U.S. citizens cannot assume a consular officer will visit them within 24-72 hours of an arrest.",
      "Currency and Exchange: The Venezuelan government maintains a strict regime of currency exchange controls. There are three different official rates to exchange U.S. Dollars (USD) into Venezuelan Bolivares (BsF). The first rate, CENCOEX, specifies exchange of 6.3 BsF per USD only for priority sectors of the economy like food, medicine, and other goods deemed essential. The second fixed exchange rate, SICAD II, is fixed at 12.8 BsF per USD and is for goods considered important but not essential. The third rate, SIMADI, fluctuates – currently around 200 BsF per USD and is intended for all other goods – like travel services. In Venezuela there also exists an illegal “black market” exchange of BsF for USD at a floating exchange rate that changes daily.",
      "Authorized exchange houses (Casas de Cambio) can buy U.S. dollars, or dollar-denominated traveler’s checks and exchange them for bolivars at the CENOCEX rate ( 6.3 BsF/USD) rate, but cannot buy bolivars and exchange them for U.S. dollars at any rate. Authorized exchange houses are located in the international airports and near most major hotels. Some hotels are also authorized to offer exchange services. It may be difficult to find exchange houses outside major cities, so a good supply of Venezuelan currency would be essential for such travel. Most major cities have ATMs with 24-hour service where users may withdraw local currency, at the SIMADI rate (currently around 200 BsF/USD), but many of these ATMs will not accept U.S.-issued debit cards. The U.S. Embassy cannot provide any currency exchange services.",
      "Most major U.S. credit cards are accepted for purchases in Venezuelan shops, restaurants, and other businesses, but the exchange rate that the merchants use can vary widely. Usually major hotels will charge rooms and other services at the SIMADI rate (approx 200 BsF/USD). Travel agencies, restaurants, shops, and hospitals will also usually charge purchases at the SIMADI rate if the purchase is made using an international debit or credit card.",
      "Travelers should check ahead of time at which rate purchases will be charged to avoid any unexpected surprises. Visa, MasterCard, and American Express have representatives in Venezuela. Credit card fraud is a significant risk and travelers should exercise caution in using their credit cards and should check statements regularly to ensure that no unauthorized charges have been made.",
      "Travelers will likely encounter individuals in Venezuela who are willing to exchange bolivares for U.S. dollars at a rate significantly higher than the official rate of exchange. These &quot;black market&quot; currency exchanges are prohibited under Venezuelan foreign exchange controls. Persons charged with violating foreign exchange controls can face criminal penalties. Travelers charged in such activity may be detained by the Venezuelan authorities. Additionally, any person who exchanges more than USD 10,000 in the course of a year through unofficial means is subject to a fine of double the amount exchanged. If the amount exceeds USD 20,000 the penalty is three to seven years imprisonment. Any person who transports more than USD 10,000 into or out of Venezuela by any means must declare this amount to customs officials.",

Incidents of taxi drivers in Caracas overcharging, robbing, injuring or even kidnapping passengers are common. Instead, U.S. citizens should use radio-dispatched taxis or taxis from reputable hotels. Travelers can call a 24-hour radio-dispatched taxi service from a public phone or ask hotel, restaurant, or airline staff to contact a licensed cab company.",

Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are active in kidnapping for ransom and have been known to operate with near impunity inside Venezuela. The State Department warns U.S. citizens not to travel within a 50-mile area along the entire Venezuela/Colombia border.

In Caracas, the homicide rate is even higher at 116 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. Most murders are never solved.",
      "Police responsiveness and effectiveness in Venezuela vary drastically but generally does not meet U.S. expectations. U.S. citizens have reported robberies and other crimes committed against them by individuals wearing uniforms and purporting to be police officers or National Guard members. Police investigations into kidnappings have revealed that police officers have been involved, and corruption within police forces is a concern. U.S. citizens are encouraged to stay away from police activity, as they may be handling an investigation of a crime.",
      "Criminal gangs operate openly and with little repercussion, often setting up fake police checkpoints. Armed robberies take place throughout Caracas and other cities, including in areas generally presumed safe and frequented by tourists. Upscale residential areas where many U.S. citizens live are not immune from street crime and home invasion robberies. Heavily armed criminals have used grenades and assault rifles to commit crimes at banks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities. Only a very small percentage of crimes results in trials and convictions.",
      "Popular tourist attractions, such as the Avila National Park in Caracas, are increasingly associated with violent crime. U.S. citizens planning to participate in outdoor activities in potentially isolated areas are strongly urged to travel in groups of five or more and to provide family or friends with their itineraries prior to departure.",

      "Kidnapping: Kidnappings are a serious problem. The number of kidnappings reported has climbed annually since 2006. Kidnappings of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals from homes, hotels, unauthorized taxis and the airport terminal are more frequently being reported to the Embassy. In addition, “express kidnappings,” in which individuals are kidnapped at gunpoint and taken to make purchases or to withdraw as much money as possible from ATMs, are a serious problem. One common practice is for kidnappers to follow potential victims into building garages and kidnap them at gunpoint, although the majority of kidnappings occur while the victims are traveling in vehicles.",
      "In Venezuela there have also been reports of “virtual kidnappings,” in which criminals collect information on minors and then use the data to call parents for ransoms without the children being taken, and “inside kidnappings,” in which domestic employees are being paid large sums of money for keys and information in order to kidnap children for ransom.",
      "Maiquetía International Airport: As stated above, travel to and from Maiquetía International Airport is particularly dangerous. The Embassy has received frequent reports of armed robberies and “express kidnappings” in taxicabs going to and from the airport. Travelers have been victims of personal property theft and muggings in the airport itself. There are multiple reports of individuals wearing what appear to be official uniforms and displaying airport or police credentials involved in crimes inside the airport, include extortion, express kidnappings, or forcing travelers to sign documents in Spanish they do not understand. For this reason, U.S. citizen travelers should be wary of all strangers, even those in official uniform or carrying official identification, and should not pack valuable items or documents in checked luggage.",

In Ho Chi Minh City, there is typically a rise in petty crime during the Christmas and Tet holiday season, including during the day and in well-lit areas. Motorcyclists are known to snatch bags, cameras, cell phones, and other valuables from pedestrians or passengers riding in &quot;cyclos&quot; (pedicabs) or on the back of motorcycles, sometimes using a sharp weapon such as a knive to cut a bag strap. Although violent crimes such as armed robbery are still relatively rare in Vietnam, perpetrators have grown increasingly bold and may carry a weapon. If you are targeted by thieves, do not resist and report the incident immediately to local police and to the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi or the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City.

      "TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in Italy, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Italy has one of the highest rates of car accident deaths in the European Union. Streets in historic city centers are often narrow, winding, and congested. Motor scooters are very popular, and scooter drivers often see themselves as exempt from conventions that apply to automobiles. Pedestrians and drivers should be constantly alert to the possibility of a scooter’s sudden presence. Most vehicle-related deaths and injuries involve pedestrians or cyclists who are involved in collisions with scooters or other vehicles. Be particularly cautious if you rent a scooter. You should remain vigilant and alert when walking or cycling near traffic. Pedestrians should be careful, as sidewalks can be extremely congested and uneven. Riders of bicycles, motorcycles, and other vehicles routinely ignore traffic signals and traffic flows, and park and drive on sidewalks. For safety, pedestrians should look carefully in both directions before crossing streets, even when using a marked crosswalk with a green avanti (&quot;walk&quot;) light illuminated.",
      "Traffic lights are limited and often disobeyed and a different convention of right-of-way is observed. Italy has over 5,600 kilometers (3,480 mi.) of Autostrada, or superhighways. Commercial and individual vehicles travel and pass on these well-maintained roads at very high speeds. In rural areas, a wide range of speed on highways makes for hazardous driving. Roads are generally narrow and often have no guardrails. Travelers in northern Italy, especially in winter, should be aware of fog and poor visibility responsible for multiple-car accidents each year. Most Italian automobiles are equipped with special fog lights. Roadside assistance in Italy is excellent on the well-maintained toll roads, but limited on secondary roads. Use of safety belts and child restraining devices is mandatory and headlights should be on at all times outside of urban areas.",
      "U.S. citizens driving in Italy should also note that, according to Italian regulation, if a resident of a non-European Union country (e.g., the United States) violates a traffic law, the violator must pay the fine at the time the violation occurs to the police officer issuing the ticket. If the citizen does not or cannot pay the fine at the time, Italian regulation allows the police officer to confiscate the offender’s vehicle (even if the vehicle is a rental vehicle).",
      "For specific information concerning Italian driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, contact the Italian Government Tourist Board (ENIT), tel: 212-245-5618; or the A.C.I. (Automobile Club d’Italia) at Via Marsala 14A, 00185 Rome, tel: 39-06-4998-2496. For information on obtaining international drivers licenses, contact AAA or the American Automobile Touring Alliance. Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Visit the website of Italy’s national tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety .",

Public hospitals, though generally free of charge for emergency services, sometimes do not maintain the same standards as hospitals in the United States, so you are encouraged to obtain insurance that would cover a stay in a private Italian hospital or clinic. It is almost impossible to obtain an itemized hospital bill from public hospitals, as required by many U.S. insurance companies, because the Italian National Health Service charges one inclusive rate for care services and room and board.",

      "Strikes and other work stoppages occur frequently in the transportation sector (national airlines, airports, trains, and bus lines); most are announced in advance and are of short duration. Reconfirmation of domestic and international flight reservations is highly recommended.",
      "You must obey local transportation laws and regulations. You must purchase train tickets and validate them by inserting them into validating machines, which are usually located near the entrance of train tracks, prior to boarding. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an on-the-spot fine by an inspector on the train. You must purchase bus tickets prior to boarding and validate them immediately after boarding. Tickets may be purchased at tobacco stores or kiosks. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an immediate fine imposed by an inspector on the bus. If the violator does not pay the fine on the spot, it will automatically double and will be forwarded to the violator’s home address.",
      "You must obey local driving laws and regulations. Vehicle traffic in some historic downtown areas of cities and towns throughout Italy is limited by a system of permits (called “ZTL,” functioning the same way as an electronic toll system in the United States might on the freeway). Cameras record the license plates of cars driving in parts of the city that require a permit. Although most of the automated verification stations are clearly marked, if a driver passes one, it is impossible to know at the time that a violation occurred or has been recorded. Violators are not pulled over or stopped, and there is no personal contact with a police officer. Whenever possible, the fines imposed for these violations are forwarded to the driver’s home in the United States to request payment. Notice from Italian authorities of a violation may take a year or longer to arrive. The fines are cumulative for each time a driver passes a control point. A similar system of automated traffic control cameras is in place in many parts of the highway system and is used to ticket speeding violations.",
      "Accessibility: While in Italy, travelers with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what is found in the United States. Many find Italy’s narrow cobbled streets and storied monuments charming; they can, however, be a challenge for physically impaired travelers. Many Italian sidewalks lack ramps, some Italian streets lack sidewalks altogether, or for instance in the case of Venice, may feature staircases and narrow pedestrian bridges. While some major sights and hotels have put time and planning into ensuring accessibility, there are others that lack ramps, elevators, or handicap-accessible bathrooms. Advance planning can go a long way in making a difference in accommodation for disabled travelers. Inform airlines and hotels of your disabilities when making reservations as some time may be needed to prepare accommodation. Call ahead to restaurants, museums, and other facilities to find out if they are wheelchair-accessible. Most, but not all, train stations in Italy have accommodations for those traveling in wheelchairs. With advance notice, personal assistance can be provided to a disabled person traveling through a particular station. More information is available at Trenitalia's website addressing disabled travelers . For those who wish to rent cars, hand-controlled vehicles are available in Italy from major car-rental companies. You should contact the car rental company well in advance of your trip in order to reserve the vehicle. Remember that Italy functions on 220 volt current. To recharge an electric wheelchair motor, you may require a transformer to change the 220 current to 110 volts, as well as an adapter to adjust the plug to fit Italian electrical sockets.",

Italian authorities and foreign diplomatic facilities have found bombs outside public buildings, received bomb threats, and have been subjects of letter bombs in the past several years. Organized crime and anarchist movements sometimes use firebombs or Molotov cocktails against buildings or offices. These attacks generally occur at night, and although they have not targeted or injured U.S. citizens, you should remain aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activity to local authorities.",

If you are drinking heavily, your ability to judge situations and make decisions may be impaired, making you a target for crime. Young drinkers are particularly vulnerable to robbery and physical and sexual assault.",
      "Petty crimes such as pick-pocketing, theft from parked cars, and purse snatching are serious problems, especially in large cities. Pick-pockets sometimes dress like businessmen. You should not be lulled into a false sense of security by believing that well-dressed individuals are not potential pick-pockets or thieves. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, on public buses and trains, and at the major railway stations: Rome's Termini; Milan's Centrale; Florence's Santa Maria Novella; and Naples's Centrale at Piazza Garibaldi. For more information on trains and security, please see the Italian railway police’s advice for travelers . You should also be alert to theft in Milan’s Malpensa Airport, particularly at car rental agencies. Clients of Internet cafes in major cities are also targeted. Be careful with your bag or purse, as thieves on motor scooters are very quick and can snatch a purse off of your arm from a moving scooter. Resisting these thieves can be hazardous, as some tourists have suffered broken arms and collarbones.",
      "Thieves in Italy often work in groups or pairs. Pairs of accomplices or groups of children are known to divert tourists' attention so that another can pick-pocket them. In one particular routine, one thief drops or spills something on the victim; a second thief assists the victim in cleaning up the mess; and the third discreetly takes the victim's belongings. Criminals on crowded public transportation slit the bottoms of purses or bags with a razor blade or sharp knife removing the contents.",
      "Some travelers in Rome, Florence, and Naples have reported incidents where criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. These incidents have been reported near Rome’s Termini train station; at bars and cafes near Rome’s Colosseum, Colle Oppio, Campo de Fiori, and Piazza Navona; and at bars and cafes in the center of Florence and Naples. Criminals using this tactic “befriend” you at a train station, restaurant, café, or bar, and then offer you a drink laced with a sleeping drug. When you fall asleep, criminals steal your valuables and may sexually assault you. Some victims of these assaults in Rome have required hospitalization and two cases resulted in death.",
      "Thieves are also known to have impersonated police officers in order to steal. The thief shows you a circular plastic sign with the words &quot;police&quot; or “international police&quot; and then in perfect English asks to see your identification and your money. U.S. citizens should be aware that local police will generally exit their own vehicle when speaking with members of the public. Also, plainclothes undercover units rarely attempt to pull over vehicles without a marked car accompanying them. If this happens to you, you should insist on seeing the officer's identification card (documento) before handing over your wallet as impersonators tend not to carry forged documents. You should immediately report thefts or other crimes to the actual police.",
      "Be alert to the possibility of carjackings and thefts while you are waiting in traffic or stopped at traffic lights. This has been a particular problem in Catania, Sicily. Use particular caution driving at night on highways, when thieves are more likely to strike. U.S. citizens have reported break-ins of their rental cars during stops at highway service areas; thieves smash car windows and steal everything inside. Theft of small items such as radios, luggage, cameras, briefcases, and even cigarettes from parked cars is prevalent. Vehicles parked near beaches during the summer can be broken into and robbed of valuables. Lock car doors whenever you park, and do not leave packages in your car in plain view.",
      "The U.S. Secret Service in Rome is assisting Italian law enforcement authorities in investigating an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. These devices are attached to legitimate bank ATMs, usually located in tourist areas, and capture the account information stored electronically on the card’s magnetic strip. The devices consist of a card reader installed over the legitimate reader and a pin-hole video camera mounted above the keypad that records the customer’s PIN. ATMs with skimming devices installed may also allow normal transactions to occur. The victim’s information is sold, traded on-line, or encoded on another card, such as a hotel key card, to access the compromised account. Here are some helpful hints to protect against and identify skimming devices:",
      "Use ATMs located in well-lighted public areas, or secured inside a bank/business; Cover the keypad with one hand as you enter your PIN; Look for gaps, tampered appearance, or other irregularities between the metal faceplate of the ATM and the card reader; Avoid card readers that are not flush with the face of the ATM; and Closely monitor your account statements for unauthorized transactions.",
      "Organized criminal groups operate throughout Italy, but are more prevalent in the south. They occasionally resort to violence to intimidate or to settle disputes. Though the activities of such groups are not generally targeted at tourists, visitors should be aware that innocent bystanders could be injured.",
      "Don’t buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal to bring back into the United States, if you purchase them, you may also be breaking local law.",

      "Most major roads are generally well maintained though many rural roads are gravel and fatal accidents are not uncommon. Tourists are often involved in single-vehicle accidents. Sand, salt, and gravel roads become very slippery when wet and more dangerous particularly at night and during the rainy season. Do not exceed 45 mph (80km) on gravel roads. Tire punctures are not unusual. Accidents involving drunk drivers are common. Other driving hazards include excessive speed, lack of street lighting and shoulders, inadequately maintained vehicles, erratic driving habits, pedestrians, wildlife, and livestock.",
      "Travel in desert areas or via the Trans-Caprivi Highway between Rundu and Katima Mulilo should be undertaken during daylight hours only. Carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions.

      "Urban roads in Apia and the main roads circumnavigating and crossing the island are all generally kept in fair condition, although bumps and potholes are common. Side streets tend to be gravel or dirt and their condition varies considerably, particularly during the rainy season when ruts and bumps develop. Roads outside Apia are often narrow, winding, relatively steep, with narrow or no shoulders, and poorly lighted. Pedestrians as well as vehicles and livestock regularly travel these roads. Due to poor and deteriorating road conditions, night driving on unlit rural roads can be dangerous and should be avoided if possible. Roads in Samoa often traverse small streams. You should exercise extreme caution when fording these streams, which can become swollen and dangerous with little warning. Vehicles should never enter a stream if the roadbed is not visible or if the water’s depth is more than the vehicle’s clearance.",
      "Taxis are widely available and used by Samoans and visitors alike. However, some are unlicensed, so you should use care in choosing a taxi and driver. Buses are slow, crowded, uncomfortable, undependable, and rarely used by visitors. You can use rental cars, but be aware that limited roadside assistance is available. Most major roads are tar-sealed, but secondary roads are predominantly dirt and gravel and may be rough and/or overgrown with vegetation. A four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended for travel on these roads. You should be aware that vehicle safety regulations are rarely enforced, and traffic violations occur routinely.",
      "In September 2009, Samoa switched from driving on the right side of the road (as in the United States) to driving on the left side (as in the United Kingdom). Some vehicles in Samoa remain left-hand drive, including rental vehicles and public transportation. There are a few significant differences in the “rules of the road” in Samoa as compared to the United States (e.g., meeting situation at an intersection). Drivers should familiarize themselves with operating requirements and local traffic laws before operating a vehicle in Samoa.",

You should have emergency evacuation insurance before you travel to Samoa.",

Dental facilities do not meet U.S. standards, but good dental treatment and some emergency medical care is available at the LBJ Tropical Medical Center in Pago Pago, American Samoa.

Persons violating Samoa’s laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Samoa are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines, or death. In Samoa, you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you or if you take pictures of certain buildings. In Samoa, driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. If you break local laws in Samoa, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution.There are also some things that might be legal in the country you visit, but still illegal in the United States. You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.",

These standards may not be strictly enforced or meet the standards of similar facilities in the United States. Parents should be aware that U.S. citizens and non-citizen nationals 16 years of age and older have a right to apply for a U.S. passport and to request repatriation assistance from the U.S. government, both without parental consent. Any U.S. citizen or non-citizen U.S. national has the right to contact a representative from the U.S. Embassy.

There have been several cases of attacks by multiple dogs. Please exercise appropriate caution when you are walking, running, or riding a bike near stray dogs.",
      "Ferry service: Although there have been no major accidents involving the ferry service linking Upolu and Savaii, vessels are sometimes overloaded. One of the ferries, a multi-deck, automobile ferry, sometimes transports passengers on its automobile deck. To avoid injury from shifting vehicles, you should ride only in the passenger compartment, not on the automobile deck during the crossing, if you choose to use this ferry.",
      "Blowholes: Samoa has numerous “blowholes” (lava tubes open to the sea where wave action produces often spectacular geysers). These blowholes are popular tourist attractions. The footing around the mouths of most blowholes is very slippery. To avoid being swept in, you should not approach too closely and should never stand between the opening of the blowhole and the sea.",
      "Water sports: Snorkeling and diving in ocean lagoons are popular activities for many visitors to Samoa. Tide changes can produce powerful currents in these lagoons. You should consult local residents and tour operators about hazards and conditions at a particular location before you venture into the water. There are virtually no lifeguards in Samoa. You are responsible for your own safety. Carefully investigate the qualifications of guides and tour operators, especially regarding water sports.",
      "Financial transactions: Although some businesses in Apia, especially those frequented by tourists, do accept credit cards, many do not, including gas stations. Major hotels and some restaurants and stores accept major credit cards (Visa, Master Card, and American Express). You can get Samoan currency from ATMs, which are located in Faleolo Airport, Salelologa, and in many locations in Apia. For more information on ATM locations and banking services, visit the ANZ Bank website or the WESTPAC website.",
      "Disaster preparedness: Samoa is located in an area of high seismic activity. Upolu and Savaii are volcanic islands. One of Savai’i’s dormant volcanoes erupts approximately once every 150 years. The most recent eruption was 1908. On September 30, 2009, an 8.0 earthquake in the South Pacific Ocean triggered tsunami waves that hit the islands of Samoa causing extensive damage to life and property, primarily on low-lying coastal areas of the south and east coasts. Major cyclones have occurred in the past and are always a concern. The cyclone season is from November to April, when strong winds, heavy rains, landslides, and disruptions to services could occur. During this period, Samoa receives most of its annual average of over 115 inches of rain. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or in Samoa from Disaster Management , the Samoa Tourism Authority , or major resort and hotel operators.",

The Crimes Ordinance 1961 and the more recent Crimes Act 2013, which came into effect 1 May 2013, criminalize same-sex acts. There is no recognition of same-sex relationships, marriage or adoption by same-sex couples in Samoa. There are also no anti-discrimination laws in place. Although the country is historically tolerant towards homosexuality, especially with regards to “fa’afafine,” the third-gendered Samoans, efforts to modernize the law under the Crimes Act 2013 were unsuccessful; however, the updated statute did eliminate the section that made it an offence for a male to dress as a female. In many Samoan families it is not uncommon to raise a male child as a girl who plays an important role in domestic duties or the work force to provide for elderly parents and younger siblings. The Samoa Fa’afafine Association with the Samoan Prime Minister as their patron is very active in its charitable work, HIV education and prevention programs.

There is no law pertaining specifically to the status of disabled persons, although the “Samoa National Policy for Persons with Disabilities 2009-2012” emphasizes the Government’s commitment to the rights and empowerment of the disabled. This policy also recognizes that the family is the main source of their support. The “Ministry of Women, Community, and Social Development” is the government ministry responsible for public outreach and social development for persons with disabilities.",
      "Most major hotels, restaurants, and cafes are actively restructuring their facilities to accommodate persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities have easy access to medical facilities. However, disabled travelers should clarify with the hotel what accommodations are available before they book. Some family-based beach accommodations in the outer villages are also working to provide accessibility for disabled persons. Many of the new multi-story buildings provide ramps and elevators, but older public buildings do not. The blind and persons in wheelchairs or on crutches will have difficulty navigating in and around Apia because of a limited number of stoplights and sidewalks.

The information below concerning Swaziland is provided for general reference only and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.",
      "Traffic accidents in Swaziland may pose an even greater hazard than crime. Visitors should use extreme caution when driving, given the relatively high rates of speed of drivers on major thoroughfares. Other hazards include poor lighting and irregular traffic signals; presence of pedestrians, animals, and slower moving vehicles; aggressive driving behavior; and erratic stopping for pedestrians and animals. Traffic drives on the left in Swaziland, which requires U.S. drivers to exercise particular caution. Special care should be used in driving at night and in fog, especially in rural areas. Rural and suburban areas are poorly lit and pose additional safety hazards as pedestrians and animals cross the road. Many vehicles are poorly maintained and lack headlights.",
      "Extreme caution is recommended if/when using mini-bus taxis, locally known as khumbis, which follow fixed routes and are flagged down by passengers almost everywhere on the streets and roads of Swaziland. Many of these vehicles fail to meet minimal safety standards. Drivers frequently overload the vehicles, travel at excessive speeds, and text/SMS or talk on cell phones while driving, which is illegal in Swaziland. Fatal accidents involving these conveyances are very common.",
      "The Royal Swaziland Police Service sets up periodic road blocks and use radar to monitor your speed. Respect the local laws. If you are pulled over for a moving violation you will be responsible for the consequences. Always drive with your driver’s license. Failure to do so will result in a fine.",

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Swaziland are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines, or death. In Swaziland, you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you or if you take pictures of certain buildings. In Swaziland, driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. If you break local laws in Swaziland, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution.",

You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws.

Societal discrimination against LGBT persons is prevalent, and LGBT persons generally conceal their sexual orientation and gender identity. Members of the LGBT community who are open about their sexual orientation and relationships face censure and exclusion from the chiefdom-based patronage system, which could result in eviction from one’s home. Chiefs, pastors, and members of government criticize same-sex sexual conduct as neither Swazi nor Christian. LGBT advocacy organizations have had trouble registering with the government. It is difficult to determine the extent of employment discrimination based on sexual orientation because victims are not likely to come forward, and most LGBT persons are not open about their sexual orientation.

In Zambia, vehicles drive on the left side of the road, and vehicles in traffic circles travel clockwise. It is illegal to turn left on a red light. Driving on Zambian roads can be hazardous. Most roads do not have shoulders or sidewalks, forcing pedestrians and livestock to use the roadways both day and night. It is a traffic violation to splash a pedestrian when driving through water. While the main roads in Lusaka and the principal highways linking Lusaka with the major provincial capitals are generally maintained, many secondary roads are in poor repair. During the rainy season (end of October to mid-March), travelers who do not have a four-wheel drive vehicle will encounter problems driving on rural roads. Even in daylight, passing another vehicle can be particularly dangerous given the general condition of roads.",

When breakdowns occur, local drivers place a few branches behind the car to indicate trouble but these are difficult to see after dark. As a result, many drivers use their high beams at night to detect stopped vehicles and pedestrians but often fail to dim their high beams when approaching other cars. Cars with non-functioning headlights and taillights are another hazard.",

Minibuses serve as the primary means of inter-city travel in Zambia but are often overcrowded, poorly maintained, and seldom punctual. Drivers often pass using road shoulders or opposing traffic lanes and frequently stop with little or no warning to pick up or drop off passengers. If you hear sirens indicating an official motorcade while you are driving, you should come to a stop and, if possible, pull to the side of the road.",

Residents of Zambia should obtain a driver’s license after obtaining a residence or study permit. Cars must have small reflective stickers attached to the bumper (white on front, red on back), and drivers should always carry two reflective triangles (used to warn other drivers if your car breaks down). Traffic officer checkpoints are fairly frequent outside of urban centers and you risk a fine if found to be driving without reflective stickers, triangles, a spare tire, or non-working headlights or indicator lights.",

      "Possession of more than 0.5 grams of an illegal substance can constitute drug trafficking in Zambia. The Zambian Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) has detained U.S. citizens for possession of antihistamines such as Benadryl and other over-the-counter medications, which contained small quantities of diphenhydramine, an active ingredient that is on Zambia’s list of controlled substances. Although unaware of these restrictions, U.S. citizens have been charged with drug-trafficking offenses, had their passports confiscated, and have been jailed. While government officials have told the Embassy that carrying such over-the-counter medications with a doctor’s prescription is permitted, U.S. citizens visiting Zambia should consider leaving such medications behind. When traveling with prescription medications, U.S. citizens should likewise carry a doctor’s prescription and ensure that the medication is in its original bottle. A complete list of controlled substances banned in Zambia is available via the U.S. Embassy website on the web page Living in Zambia . U.S. citizens carrying any of these banned drugs for medical purposes should contact the Government of Zambia’s Pharmaceutical Authority to request advance permission to bring the drugs into the country by emailing the Director General at pharmacy@pra.gov.zm or writing to: Director General Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority, Box 31890 Lusaka. The office is located at Plot No 6903 Tuleteka Road, off Makish Road.

You should make sure that you receive an official receipt from the Zambian government for any fines and duties you pay.

Credit card fraud exists in Zambia and there have been several cases involving fraudulent charges, including some at major hotels catering primarily to foreign visitors. Some businesses use carbonized paper documents to process payment. These documents are not secure and can pose a threat to cardholders. You should be cautious when using debit or credit cards at any point of purchase, especially if the transaction is not processed electronically. U.S. citizen travelers can withdraw money (in local currency) from ATMs in major cities in Zambia using their ATM cards or credit cards from the United States. Occasionally, banks lose their connections with the credit card exchanges, thus making withdrawals impossible. U.S. citizens have also been victims of ATM fraud, whereby criminals gain access to the U.S. citizen's pin number and make withdrawals. Zambian banks and bureau de change will not accept dollar-denominated notes issued before 2000 (i.e., those without the larger, off-center portraits). Travelers’ cheques are generally not accepted by banks in Zambia.",

However, U.S. citizens are advised to avoid rafting and other whitewater boating activities on the Zambezi River below Victoria Falls during the high-water season, February through June. During periods of high water, the Batoka Gorge section of the river becomes unpredictable and several tourists have been involved in fatal accidents. Please observe local or park regulations and heed all instructions given by tour guides. Even in the most serene settings, wild animals can pose a threat to life and safety.
